I have summarized some of the relevant information which is on my CV herein.\n\n3. I hold a bachelor's degree and master's degree in Computer Science from New York Institute of Technology. I also hold a doctorate in Professional Studies from Pace University's School of Computer Science and Information Systems. I have worked in network consulting and technology for over 25 years. During this time, I have actively been involved with the design and development of a wide range of networks and software products. In many times during my career, I have had to perform evaluations of technology to determine the value or impact that technology has on a larger product. I have performed the methodology that I have employed in this report that I use to apportion the value of the infringing technologies dozens of times throughout my career. This methodology is the same one I used at both Lockheed Martin and McAfee to evaluate the value of a technology (almost all related to the field of security) and\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nthe specific contributions of that technology (or intellectual property (' IP ') or a patent) to a product. I have also employed this methodology many times in a consulting role, including in the context of specific transactions or business activities unrelated to litigation. I apply the same methodology inside and outside of litigation. Further, I have reviewed the Asserted Patents, and I am deeply familiar with, and have deep experience in, the field of security described in the patents.\n\n4. I am a member of the European InfoSec Hall of Fame, a professional membership awarded by nomination and election by a panel of industry experts. I have also been awarded cyber air wings by the US Air Force for my contribution to their cybersecurity program. I have also served on a commission on cybersecurity for the 44 th President.\n\n5. I am the founder of Secure Anchor Consulting where I provide technology advisory and security consulting services, and lead research and development initiatives to advance information security and technology. My activities as part of Secure Anchor Consulting include helping organizations acquire and sell technology and providing advice on the importance, value and relative value of the technology in question. In this role, I have reviewed hundreds of licenses on various areas of networking and consumer-based technology. I also will evaluate technology to determine the value or impact technology adds to a given product. I was a Fellow and instructor with The SANS Institute, a research and education organization consisting of information security professionals.\n\n6. I am an author of several security courses, such as SEC401-Security Essentials and SEC501-Enterprise Defender taught at SANS. SEC401 is the flagship product for SANS and was their top selling course for 15 years. It teaches students the fundamental and foundational components of cybersecurity and includes sections on operating systems and how technology\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nintegrates into various products. There are sections that talk about Intel 's products and the security implemented into their products.\n",

I have worked for the federal government for 8 years as an employee and have held various contracting jobs with government agencies, which involved working with classified information. I have held various top-secret security clearances with the Department of Defense ( ' DOD ' ), Central Intelligence A gency ('CIA') , and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( ' NRC ' ). I have worked for a wide range of government organizations including Federal Bureau of I nvestigation ('FBI') , National Security Agency, CIA, Department of Energy, DOD, the Treasury, Secret Service, and the NRC.\n\n8. While serving as a Senior Officer for the CIA as a Program Manager / Technical Director for the Internet Program Team with Office of Technical Services, I implemented the Internet Program Team that designs, develops, tests, and deploys Internet security products in 3to-6-month intervals. In this role, I received a letter of appreciation from the DCI (Director Central Intelligence) and six Exceptional Performance Awards. These awards were based off of the work I did in building Artificial I ntelligence ('AI') systems to help catch high valued targets and for starting and creating key initiatives across the organization.\n\n9. As a member of the Information Security Assessment Team with the Office of Security, I also evaluated and performed assessments of network operating systems solutions. As part of my work, I designed a large-scale auditing system with automated review capability and worked on several virus investigations for the Office of Security.\n\n10. In my role as Chief Information Officer for the American Institutes for Research, I repaired and developed network infrastructures for various organizations and provided technical support for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nthe United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. This included performing analyses of the technology space and determining the overall value new technology would represent. The technology was licensed to several organizations, and I was actively involved in assessing the value and reviewing the terms and conditions of the licensing agreements. In this context, I used the same apportionment methodology I have employed in this report. The technology involved intrusion detection systems that would help secure and prevent networks from attack.\n\n11. As Chief Scientist and Senior Fellow for Lockheed Martin, I performed research and development in network and information systems security. I also specialized in evaluating and designing secure networks, perimeter defense, vulnerability discovery, penetration testing, and intrusion detection systems. At Lockheed Martin, I served as a technical advisor in highprofile security projects for government clients including the Department of Defense, the FBI Sentinel case management systems, Department of Homeland Security Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge solutions, Jet Propulsion Labs, Hanford Labs, and FBI Information Assurance Technology Infusion programs. These systems all involved networking and cybersecurity systems that were deployed on desktops, servers and mobile devices. It involved analyzing networking packets to determine whether they were indicative of an attack and should be blocked from accessing a device.\n",

At Lockheed Martin, I was also actively involved in evaluating technology, patents, licenses for intellectual property, and other forms of intellectual property to determine their overall value. This was done from multiple fronts, including for investment, for acquiring or obtaining a license to technology, for acquiring patents, for selling technology, and for selling patents. In many instances, I had to break down a product into various components to determine\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nthe value of a specific technology added to the overall product. I used the same apportionment methodology in that role that I have used in this report. For multiple years, on a regular basis I would review the technology covered by prior licenses and transactions and compare how similar it was to other technology that Lockheed Martin was considering licensing, acquiring, or selling. The purpose of these comparisons was to help us determine whether prior licenses and transactions were useful reference points for pricing and relative value.\n\n13. As Chief Technical Officer for McAfee, I executed the technology strategy for technology platforms, partnerships, and external relationships to establish product vision and achieve McAfee's goals and business strategies. I was responsible for the development of new products, and the ongoing challenge of keeping existing products up to date and relevant in the market. In this capacity, I worked closely with groups tasked with the development of intellectual property. In this role I also was constantly looking at new technology to acquire and had to perform various types of apportionment to determine the value a certain component added to an overall technology -most often related to device security. I would use the same apportionment methodology I have used in this report. This also included analysis and review of licenses to determine whether any were technologically comparable.\n\n14. Even today I am often called upon by investors and companies buying and selling technology to evaluate the overall value and/or importance of a certain piece of technology. Most of this work specifically relates to device security, which has been my specialization for many years and is the focus of my current work. The methodology involves a qualitative approach in which the overall device is broken down into key components to assess how much of a given technology attributes to the overall device. The methods and practices I performed to put together this report, including my opinions, are based on common practices utilized by\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\norganizations to evaluate the value of certain components of a technology within a larger product. They are the same methods I have employed many times in an industry setting.\n\n15. A comprehensive outline of my experience in cybersecurity can be found in my attached CV.\n\n## B. Prior Testimony\n\n16. A list of cases in which I have testified at deposition, at trial, or in written reports is attached to this Report as Appendix A.\n\n## C. Compensation\n\n17. My rate of compensation for my work in this case is $750 per hour plus any direct expenses incurred. My compensation is based solely on the amount of time that I devote to activity related to this case and is in no way affected by any opinions that I render. I receive no other compensation from work on this action. My compensation is not dependent on the outcome of this matter, the opinions I render, or the content of any testimony that I provide.\n\n## II. Materials Considered\n",

In forming my opinions, I have also talked with Dr. Christian Peeters and reviewed his report regarding infringement. I did not form a separate opinion on infringement, but instead relied on Dr. Peeters's analysis.\n\n20. In the process of preparing this Report and forming my opinions, I have reviewed and consider numerous documents and items. These include the Asserted Patent and its file history and documents and deposition transcripts produced in this case. In addition to these materials and all of the materials referenced in this Report, a list of the materials that I have considered in forming my opinions is attached as Appendix B.\n\n## III.

Description of the Asserted Patents\n\nI  understand  from  Dr.  Peeters  report  that  the  '152  patent  is  directed  to  te chniques  for coordinating when a wireless device transitions between sleep and active modes using timing and synchronization  information.  It  discloses  mechanisms  for  scheduling  wake  times  based  on assigned time slots, employing timers to control sleep and wake behavior, monitoring for expected\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nbeacon  transmissions,  and  taking  corrective  actions -such  as  resetting  timers  or  changing channels -when expected communications are not detected. These mechanisms enable a device to  minimize  idle  listening,  remain  in  low-power  states  for  extended  periods,  and  reliably  resynchronize  with  the  network,  thereby  improving  power  efficiency  and  battery  life  while maintaining reliable wireless connectivity. As explained by Dr. Peeters in his infringement report \u00b6\u00b6  60 and 212 ,  the  mechanisms disclosed and claimed in the '152 patent are foundational to Target Wake Time in that they provide the core timer-driven wake scheduling, synchronization, and resynchronization behavior upon which later TWT implementations are built.\n\n## V.

    "core_text": "23. I was asked to assess the incremental value of the asserted claims of the ' 152 Patent that Dr. Peeters opines is infringed by Intel within the accused functionalities, or what value of benefit the Asserted Patent contributed overall to the Intel products accused of infringement (the 'Intel Accused Products') relative to other features and benefits of the accused products. In order to do that, I examined a number of non-public technical documents and public documents related to the accused functionalities, as well as surveys and other internal studies and reports conducted by Intel regarding the accused functionalities To develop my opinion on this value, I have used my knowledge, skill, education, experience, training, and expertise as well as my review of the documents that I have identified in Appendix B and throughout this report. In undertaking this analysis, I applied the same methodology I have used repeatedly in my industry work, which requires determining the portion of the overall product value that is properly attributed to the patented technology.  This process, known as apportionment, involves crafting an approach tailored to the specific technology at issue so that only the economic value associated with the asserted patent is captured. Moreover, in reaching this value, I have also\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nrelied upon the discussion in my report of the Asserted Patent and the various features of the accused functionalities.\n\n## A. Infringing TWT Functionality\n\n24. In forming my opinions on incremental value , I rely on Dr. Peeters' technical analysis and conclusions regarding how the accused Intel products implement the asserted claims of the 152 patent. As Dr. Peeters explains, 'the '152 patent is foundational to the timing and wake-scheduling mechanisms tha t make Target Wake Time (TWT) effective,' and the patented functionality 'provides the foundational elements that are responsible for TWT's core benefits, including reduced idle listening, improved power efficiency, extended battery life, and coordinated w ake opportunities.' I understand from Dr. Peeters that these claimed mechanisms are implemented in Intel's Accused Products, i.e., Wi-Fi 6-class (and above) chipsets, and enable the very efficiency improvements introduced by TWT that distinguish Wi-Fi 6 from prior generations. 1 I therefore incorporate Dr. Peeters' technical findings as the basis for identifying the value of the Accused Products attributable to the patented functionality and for determining the appropriate apportionment in a reasonable royalty calculation.\n\n25. ' [T]he overlap in technical operation demonstrates that the patented functionality provides the foundational elements that make TWT effective and that are responsible for its core benefits, including reduced idle listening, improved power efficiency, extended battery life, and coordinated wake opportunities.' 2 As a result, the asserted claims of the '152 patent are directly tied to the very technical mechanisms that enable the efficiency improvements attributed to TWT -namely, the use of synchronization information, timers that control sleep and wake\n\n[FOOTNOTE 1: To the extent documents appear in the body of my report but are not listed here, they are incorporated by reference.]\n\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n[FOOTNOTE 2: Id .]\n\nbehavior, and corrective actions taken when expected beacons are not detected. These claim elements form the essential functionality that allows a device to remain in low-power mode and wake only at coordinated times, which is the principal source of the battery-life and efficiency improvements associated with WiFi 6. As explained in Dr. Peeters' infringement analysis, the Intel Accused Products implement these claim-required structures and behaviors in their firmware and MAC state machines, and these functions are what permit the accused Intel chipsets to achieve the power-efficiency advantages marketed to OEMs. Accordingly, the technical value attributed to improved power efficiency and reduced idle listening in Intel's Wi -Fi 6 Accused Products is tied to, and enabled by, the claimrequired functionality of the '152 patent\n",

    "core_text": "26. Traditionally, a starting point for an apportionment analysis could be the accused app or device, in this case, the Intel Accused Products, i.e ., Wi-Fi modules implementing Wi-Fi 6 / 6e / 7. The Accused Products represent the smallest saleable unit because they are sold to end users and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Asus, etc. for incorporation into laptops and desktop computers. These modules include the AX101, AX200, AX201, AX203, AX210, AX211, AX411, AX1650, AX1675, AX1690, BE200, BE201, BE202, and BE1750.  These modules have been 'purposedly designed for the PC segment.'\n\nCox Deposition, at 61:10-11. However, it is important to remember that these modules are also an individual component of a PC, such as laptop, not the entire PC.  If a completed PC were the product sold by Intel, it would be necessary to determine the value of Wi-Fi with respect to the value of the entire PC. But to my knowledge Intel does not sell PCs and no PCs have been alleged to infringe.  Rather, Intel sells Wi-Fi modules for PCs, which to my knowledge have been alleged to infringe as set forth by Dr. Peeters.\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\n27. Looking at just these Accused Wi-Fi modules, their product names focus solely on Wi-Fi. For instance, the AX211 has the product name 'Intel \u00ae WiFi 6E AX211.' 3 However, as the AX211 Product Brief reveals, the module also contains Bluetooth 5.4 functionality in addition to Wi-Fi. Thus, the Wi-Fi modules are really Wi-Fi / Bluetooth modules. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine the value of the Wi-Fi functionality of these devices with respect to their Bluetooth functionality. The latter is used to connect peripherals to PCs, such as speakers, headphones, keyboards, and mice.  Accordingly, Bluetooth adds some value to the Wi-Fi modules.  But Bluetooth is plainly not the most prominent or most desirable of the feature of the modules, as it is not even included in the product name. Rather, the product name solely references Wi-Fi. indicating Wi-Fi is the most prominent and desirable feature adding value to both consumers and OEMs. Thus, Intel's naming convention suggests that Wi-Fi adds more value to the modules than Bluetooth. To be conservative, however, I will apportion 50% of the value of any module to Wi-Fi and 50% to Bluetooth. This overstates the value of Bluetooth to these modules, and reflects a conservative estimate of the value to be apportioned to Wi-Fi.\n\n28. Not all of Intel's Wi-Fi 6 / 6E / 7 are alleged to infringe. Rather, it is my understanding that only Target Wake Time (TWT) as described in the '152 Patent is the accused functionality. It is therefore necessary to determine the value of TWT as described in th e '152\n\n[BATES:INTEL_PROX_00029772]\n[FOOTNOTE 3: INTEL_PROX_00029772 (AX 2111 Product Brief 'Wi -Fi' is mentioned 55 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only  13  times); see  also INTEL_PROX_00029779 (AX101 Product Brief - WiFi'  is  mentioned  34  times  while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 18 times); INTEL_PROX_00029755 (AX 201 Product Brief - WiFi' is mentioned 35 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 18 times); INTEL_PROX_00029788 (AX 203 Product Brief - WiFi' is mentioned 32 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 1 7 times); INTEL_PROX_00029764 (AX210 Product Brief - WiFi' is mentioned 52 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 13 times); INTEL_PROX_00029772 (AX211 Product Brief -WiFi' is mentioned 55 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 13 times); INTEL_PROX_00029796 (AX411/AX1690  Product  Brief  -  WiFi'  is  mentioned  55  times  while  'Bluetooth'  is mentioned only 13 times); INTEL_PROX_00029804 (BE200 Product Brief - WiFi' is ment ioned 49 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 18 times); INTEL_PROX_00029811 (BE201 Product Brief - WiFi' is mentioned 49 times while 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 18 times); INTEL_PROX_00617498 (BE202 Product Brief - WiFi' is mentioned 46 times whi le 'Bluetooth' is mentioned only 16 times).]\n\nMulti-User MIMO\n\n40V\n\nOFDMA\n\nBeamforming\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\npatent with respect to various Wi-Fi standards.

PROX\\_INTEL-00004256 at 57.  As the features work together, each is dependent on TWT. This is confirmed by the literature. For instance, studies have stated that TWT ' helps in reducing the power consumption of the devices while also reducing the overall contention for the channel.' PROX\\_INTEL-00004224 . Likewise, it has been shown that TWT will 'min imize energy consumption and contention within the Basic Service Set (BSS), that is, the wireless network formed by the AP and the associated stations.'

OFDMA technology, by contrast, is focused on efficient use of available spectrum, reducing latency and increasing throughput for devices. 4 Accordingly, by reducing contention, TWT improves the functioning of devices lacking the key capabilities of Wi-Fi 6. This suggests the value of TWT is greater than that of the other key features of Wi-Fi 6.\n\n30. Still, TWT works together with the other key features of Wi-Fi 6 to provide optimal functioning at an optimal level.  For instance, studies have shown that ' that key QoS [(Quality of Service)] metrics can be met for streaming traffic upon enabling TWT even in the presence of peak background congestion in the network.' PROX\\_INTEL-00003692.\n\n31. Accordingly, TWT, as covered by the '152 patent, is an important feature of WiFi 6 capable devices. It works with the other key features of Wi-Fi 6 to provide optimal throughput and quality of service. This would suggest TWT's value for Wi-Fi 6 devices is at least equal to that of the other key features as they contribute as a whole to providing optimal functionality. As one of eight cooperating major features identified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, the value of TWT with respect to Wi-Fi 6 would be roughly 12.5%. This, however, is only a conservative estimate that does not fully capture the value of TWT.  As noted, TWT improves the functioning of legacy devices on the network. Accordingly, by adding TWT devices to a home or business network an improvement will also be seen in the operation of legacy and other non-TWT devices. The ability to increase the performance of devices lacking the other key capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 means that TWT has a disproportionate value with respect to the key features of Wi-Fi 6. Thus, in my opinion, it should be valued more than 12.5%. But the increased value of TWT will also decrease with time. Eventually legacy devices will be replaced with\n\n[BATES:PROX_INTEL-00004358]\n[FOOTNOTE 4: PROX_INTEL-00004358, PROX_INTEL-00004372, PROX_INTEL-00004378]\n\n4x the Wi-Fi Capacity!\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\n2-4x throughput increase over\n\n802.11ac\n\nCISCO\n\nnewer devices. As this occurs, the extra value TWT provides to network with legacy devices will decrease because the number of networks with legacy devices and the amount of legacy devices on those networks will decrease.  Accordingly, over time the value of TWT will become directly proportional to the other key features of Wi-Fi 6. As such, 12.5% is one potential forward looking conservative apportioned value.

There can be no real debate that TWT is a key feature of Wi-Fi 6 devices, including the Accused Products. Using either Cisco's or Intel's assessment of the key features of Wi-Fi 6 provides higher proportional values of 16.67% and 25%, respectively.  Thus, 12.5% is the lowest proportional value amongst the three and thus the most conservative.\n35. The divergence in key features likely stems from the importance of the features to different organizations, each of which has a different focus. The W-Fi Alliance is concerned with Wi-Fi in general and all its various possible implementations. Cisco's focus is more limited to routers and enterprise solutions. Whereas Intel 's product s are ' purposedly designed for the PC segment, ' e.g., home and small business consumers. Cox Deposition, at 61:10-11. Intel's identification of key features is aligned with the market constraints of PC components and the needs of OEMs and end consumers. Accordingly, a 25% apportioned value for TWT with respect to Wi-Fi 6 is undeniably more reflective of the market for which Intel's Wi -Fi modules\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nhave been optimized. Still, 12.5% is the lowest proportional value amongst the three and thus the most conservative.\n\n36. The value of TWT with respect to Wi-Fi 6 has increased over time. For instance, as noted above, the Wi-Fi Alliance listed TWT as one of eight key features of Wi-Fi 6. Yet with the release of Wi-Fi 6E extension to Wi-Fi 6, the Wi-Fi Alliance listed TWT as one of six core features. PROX\\_INTEL-00004254 at 55. Thus, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance, the proportional value of TWT increased from 12.5% to 16.67%. This brings the WiFi Alliance's proportionate value for TWT in line with that of Cisco.\n\n37. The value of TWT further increased with the release of Wi-Fi 7. ' Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) introduces Restricted Target Wake Time (R-TWT), which is based on the Target Wake Time (TWT) mechanism as described in the '152 Patent a nd  from Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax).' PROX\\_INTEL-00003790. Accordingly, as with TWT of Wi-Fi 6, 'R -TWT effectively provides low-latency guarantees for latency-sensitive traffic, such as IoT and RT applications, while maintaining energy efficiency and consistent per-flow throughput and reliable channel access across varying network sizes.' PROX\\_INTEL-00003790 at 97. Thus, RTWT incorporates and provides all the benefits of TWT. Interesting, Intel identifies R-TWT as one of three core capabilities of Wi-Fi 7, as shown in the below figure.\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nEnablers\n\nMulti-radio clients/ APs\n\nWireless TSN\n\nTime synch (IAS)\n\nTime-aware scheduling (.1Qbv)\n\nRedundancy (ICB)\n\nQoS management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n",

In other words, according to Intel, TWT is becoming more valuable with time.\n39. While the value of TWT may be increasing with time, the damage period is fixed. As such, the value of TWT must be determined at the beginning of this fixed damages period. The most conversative proportioned value, considering TWT across all the varied use cases for Wi-Fi, is 12.5%.\n40. But as per the discussion above and my conservative approach to recognizing the value of Wi-Fi in the Accused Products, Wi-Fi is  one half of the functionality provided by Intel's modules , which also include Bluetooth.  Accordingly, according to my conservative assumption, half of the value of Intel Accused Products come for their use of Wi-Fi 6 / 6E / 7.\n\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n[BATES:PROX_INTEL-00003959]\n[FOOTNOTE 5: See PROX_INTEL-00003959 at 73]\n\nTherefore, the proportioned value of TWT in Wi-Fi should be multiplied by the proportioned value of Wi-Fi with respect to the modules (i.e., 0.5 * 12.5%), resulting in a total proportioned value for TWT of 6.25%. Again, this is a very conservative valuation that ignores the increasing recognized value of TWT over time and the specifics of the PC market for which Intel's products are purposedly designed and marketed. If both were considered, the proportioned value of TWT for Intel's Wi -Fi modules (again assuming Bluetooth and Wi-Fi have equal value, which the Product clearly indicates they do not) would be 12.5% increasing to 16.67%. But again, to be conservative I would assign an apportioned value of TWT for Intel's Wi -Fi 6 / 6E / 7 modules of 6.25%.\n\n41. Again, this  valuation, however, does not consider that Intel's products are ' purposedly designed for the PC segment, versus many of [their] competitors that have silicon that's designed, say, for other segments, like the phones or IoT or whatever' . Cox Deposition, at 61:10-13. Intel's customers in the PC segment are OEMs and end users for whom battery life is important. 'So Dell and other OEMs, of course, want to have -- they want to maximize the platform battery life -- right -because these are mobile devices.' Cox Deposition, at 62:4-7. Accordingly, Intel's customers ' -- PC OEMs, they like to -- to, you know, measure that and make sure that they have good performance while on battery and for a long time.' Cox Deposition, at 66:3-5. As for the end user, ' [t]hey want to have, you know, a good experience for a long time while on battery power.' Cox Deposition, at 62:8-9 . Intel recognizes for PCs , which Intel's product s are purposedly designed that for, 'battery life is -- is important. ' Cox Deposition, at 66:12. Accordingly, rather than taking a general valuation, it useful to focus on the specific value of improved battery life provided by TWT.\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\n42. In my experience with OEM procurement practices and platform-feature evaluations, OEMs do not select Wi-Fi chipsets based on the nominal ' version ' or the standard implemented alone, but on the measurable performance characteristics that affect user experience. The central difference between Wi-Fi 6 and earlier generations is not peak throughput (as the prior versions had focused on), but efficiency: reduced idle listening, coordinated wake scheduling, and improved power-save behavior. 6 Real world testing and a stream of recent publications support my opinion that these efficiency upgrades, rather than raw data rate increases, lead to real-world battery savings which in turn drove OEM adoption of WiFi 6 because they translate into longer battery life and more consistent performance under realworld conditions. 7 Thus, when OEMs choose a Wi-Fi 6 chipset over a Wi-Fi 5 chipset, they are primarily purchasing the efficiency and battery-life advantages made possible by features such as scheduled wake timing. 8\n",

First, we determine the battery life improvement provided by Intel Wi-Fi modules incorporating the infringing TWT functionality. Intel identified this problem in laptops in 2018, before WiFi 6 was released. 13 With TWT, Intel reports an additional 2.5 hours of extra battery life. 14 Notably, that chart states that the battery savings 'cannot be achieved on non -Intel wir eless solutions.' 15 Intel this reported that its Wi-Fi 6 modules can provide up to approximately 2.5 hours of additional battery life relative to competing solutions. Of this, approximately 30 minutes is associated with Intel's CNVi architecture, which applies only to specific modules such as the AX211 and does not extend to discrete modules such as the AX210. Intel openly advertises longer battery life or 'power save' in its product briefs for the accused products. 16 To avoid overstating the value across the entire accused product family, I exclude the CNVi-specific implementations and will focus on the approximately two hours of improvement that Intel attributes to platform-agnostic Wi-Fi 6 efficiency features.

Step 2 considers the relative value of the unique power saving feature and efficient power management representing TWT compared to the other unique features that distinguish the infringing products from those offered by Intel's competitors. The TWT feature is one of three unique features and only the one alleged to infringe. On Intel's chart, the segment labeled 'Unique power features &amp; efficient power management protocols'-which Intel's internal materials identify as including the coordinated TWT wake-scheduling behavior enabled by the patented technology -appears visually larger than the other two components and represents the most substantial contributor to the reported battery-life improvement. To remain conservative, however, rather than attributing the full relative weight implied by Intel's depiction, I apportion only one-third of the previously identified 20% incremental battery-life benefit to the infringing functionality. This allocation reflects a balanced and intentionally understated assessment of the patented contribution, while still recognizing that Intel itself\n\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n[BATES:INTEL_PROX_00029818]\n[FOOTNOTE 19: INTEL_PROX_00029818, at 843 (red markup added).]\n\ndepicts this category as the dominant driver of efficiency gains. Accordingly, the overall value of the infringing TWT technology is 6.66% (i.e., 0.20 x 0.3333 = 0.06666 or 6.66%).\n\n48. While this estimate is slightly higher than the conservative 6.25% proportioned value obtained by looking at TWT with respect to the other key features Wi-Fi, that valuation fails to account for fact that Intel's products are ' purposedly designed for the PC segment, versus many of [their] competitors that have silicon that's designed, say, for other segments, like the phones o r IoT or whatever'. Cox Deposition, at 61:10-13. That that PC segment 'battery life is --is important.' Cox Deposition, at 66:12. Accordingly, while TWT across all segments may only have a portioned value of 12.5%, reduced to 6.25% when consider with respect to Bluetooth included with Intel's Wi -Fi modules, it has a higher value within the PC segment. This is reflected by Intel listing it as one of four key features of Wi-Fi 6 / 6E and one of three core features of Wi-Fi 7. Accordingly, Intel acknowledges that for the PC segment, which Intel's products are purposedly designed for, TWT has a higher value than in market in general. Accordingly, the value of 6.66% captures the increased value TWT has in connection with the Accused Products within Intel's targeted market segment.\n\n49. At the same time, it is still a conservative estimate. If we consider the proportioned value of TWT with respect to other key features Intel has identified for its targeted market segment, we get a portioned value of 25% for Wi-Fi 6 / 6E that increases to 33% for WiFi 7. Factoring Bluetooth functioning, the proportioned value is reduced to 12.5% and 16.67%, respectively. These higher values reflect the ability of TWT to reduce contention to provide an optimum level of functioning, including for legacy devices, in addition to increasing battery life. While these are certainly valuable, Intel is marketing battery life to its customers and the ultimate end users within Intel's chosen market segment. Accordingly, the value of 6.66% reflects only\n\n## HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\n\nthe benefit of TWT that Intel's believes matters most to the PC market.
