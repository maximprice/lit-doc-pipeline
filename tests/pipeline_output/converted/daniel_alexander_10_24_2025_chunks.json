Fine, thank\n24  you.\n25    Q  As you heard, my name is\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  David Hecht, I'm representing the Plaintiff\n 3  in this matter.\n 4    You might see some of my\n 5  colleagues on the call, they are just\n 6  listening in.\n 7    Have you been deposed before?\n 8    A  No.\n 9    Q  Okay.  And for the record,\n10  what's your full name?\n11    A  My full name is Danny or\n12  Daniel Alexander.\n13    Q  You said you were not deposed\n14  before?\n15    A  No.\n16    Q  Okay.  So, I'll just go over\n17  a couple of ground rules.\n18    If at any point during the\n19  deposition you have any difficulty\n20  understanding my question, feel free to ask\n21  me to clarify or repeat.  Is that okay?\n22    A  Yes.\n23    Q  And then at various times\n24  during the deposition your attorney may\n25  object to my questions.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    That's normal, but you're\n 3  still required to answer unless your\n 4  attorney explicitly tells you not to answer\n 5  due to privilege, specifically.\n 6    Does that make sense to you?\n 7    A  Yes, I understand that.\n 8    Q  Okay.  And if you need to\n 9  take a break at any point, just let me know.\n10  I'll probably take breaks every hour.  Is\n11  that okay with you?\n12    A  Yes.\n13    Q  Mr. Alexander, where do you\n14  live?\n15    A  I live in Israel, in the\n16  center of Israel.\n17    Q  Do you work for Intel\n18  Corporation?\n19    A  I work for Intel Corporation,\n20  yes.\n21    Q  Do you understand today\n22  you're being put up by Intel as a designated\n23  corporate representative?\n24    A  Yes, I understand that.\n25    Q  So you understand that your\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  testimony today will bind Intel as a\n 3  company?\n 4    A  I don't really understand\n 5  what that means, I'm sorry.  I don't\n 6  understand the question.\n 7    Can you explain it in\n 8  different words, please?\n 9    Q  Yes.  Do you understand that\n10  you're speaking on behalf of Intel for your\n11  answers as a corporate representative?\n12    A  I understand.\n13    MR. HIRSCH:  Give me time, I\n14    object to the form.  You can answer.\n15    A  I am speaking of what I know,\n16  I work at Intel, and I'm saying the truth,\n17  obviously.\n18    Q  Absolutely.  So you\n19  understand you're under oath, everything has\n20  to be truthful?\n21    A  Of course.\n22    Q  But your role as a designated\n23  corporate representative means that on the\n24  various topics you are speaking for Intel.\n25  Do you understand that?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n 3    form, the topics -- as we have\n 4    narrowed the topics in our responses\n 5    and objections to the 30(b)(6).\n 6    You can answer, sir.\n 7    A  I have no -- I have no\n 8  answer.  I said my answer before, I can\n 9  repeat it.\n10    I work at Intel and I am\n11  telling you everything I know about any\n12  question you give me.\n13    Q  Okay.  Do you understand that\n14  Intel has designated you to speak for the\n15  company on certain topics subject to certain\n16  objections?\n17    A  I understand that, yes.",

Just let me\n11    know, I'll try to shut off whatever\n12    it is.\n13    I am just looking for the\n14    document.\n15    Q  Okay.  If you refresh your\n16  web browser on that link I gave you, it\n17  might take a minute.\n18    It should be on now.\n19    A  Yes.\n20    Q  And so, with these documents,\n21  the same will be true for any of these\n22  exhibits.\n23    (The above described document was\n24    marked Exhibit 1 for identification as of\n25    this date.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  I have labeled this as\n 3  Exhibit 1, but the -- you can access them\n 4  either in a preview mode on the web browser,\n 5  or you can download it and then hopefully\n 6  open it in Adobe.\n 7    I leave it to you.  Typically\n 8  it's better to download the full file and\n 9  then open it, especially with Excel\n10  spreadsheets.\n11    A  Yeah.\n12    Q  Are you able to open this\n13  file?\n14    A  But in browser mode.  I'm\n15  trying to see how I download it.  One\n16  second.\n17    Q  This one happens to be short\n18  enough, you can probably look at it in\n19  browser mode, but I leave it to you.\n20    A  Okay, yeah, I have it.\n21    Q  Okay.\n22    Have you seen this document\n23  before?  This is a notice of Rule 30(b)(6)\n24  deposition?\n25    A  Let me read it.  I think I\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  saw it, I saw it, yes.\n 3    Q  When did you first see this\n 4  document?\n 5    A  A couple of days ago I think,\n 6  maybe.\n 7    Q  I'll ask you to scroll down\n 8  if you start on page 3, it says attachment\n 9  2, topics?\n10    A  Page 3, attachment 2 topics.\n11    Q  Okay so the first topic that\n12  you're designated on is actually on the next\n13  page, which is topic 6.\n14    Do you see that topic?\n15    MR. HIRSCH:  Counsel for the\n16    record again I'll state as you know\n17    Mr. Alexander as been designated to\n18    testify as to topics subject to our\n19    objections and how we have clarified\n20    and narrowed the topics.\n21    MR. HECHT:  Yes, I just want\n22    him to you know just recognize what\n23    the topics are generally.\n24    MR. HIRSCH:  No, understood,\n25    look its your deposition, I suggest\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    showing the topics as in our\n 3    objections and responses, but again,\n 4    it's your deposition.\n 5    Q  Do you recognize this topic,\n 6  this topic 6?\n 7    A  Yeah, I understand what it\n 8  is, yes.\n 9    Q  So I'm not going to go\n10  through each of the others, because you are\n11  designated on a number of topics.\n12    MR. HECHT:  For the record,\n13    it is topics 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n14    13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 26, 27, 28, 32,\n15    33, 36, 44.\n16    Does that roughly sound\n17    familiar to you?\n18    MR.

HECHT:  One rule that I\n24    hadn't clarified, that I will, is\n25    when you respond to the questions,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    you have to respond verbally, for\n 3    the court reporter.\n 4    So, no head nods, just a yes\n 5    or no, or, if that suffices, or an\n 6    answer.\n 7    A  I understand, yeah, the",

HIRSCH:  Same\n13    instruction, sir.  You can answer\n14    the question with factual\n15    information you have.\n16    Don't provide the content of\n17    any discussions you might have had\n18    with any of your attorneys.\n19    A  Yeah.  So I understand there\n20  is a patent that Proxense wrote a while back\n21  for technology that relates to low power\n22  devices and in casino rooms assets, stuff\n23  like that, as far as I read.\n24    And I understand is far from\n25  any WIFI technology that Intel's products\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  are doing.\n 3    That's my understanding.  I\n 4  read through the information and I\n 5  understand it's -- you think it relates to\n 6  TWT.  I don't see how.  That's more or less\n 7  my understanding.\n 8    Q  Okay, fair enough.\n 9    Did you review any of\n10  Proxense's other patents?\n11    A  No.\n12    Q  Are you a member of the IEEE?\n13    A  No, no.  I mean, I attended\n14  during COVID maybe two or three meetings on\n15  a Zoom link, because that was easy.\n16    But I'm not part of the\n17  standard team at Intel, and I'm not a member\n18  of IEEE.\n19    Q  You mentioned the standard\n20  team at Intel.  Intel is a member --\n21    MR.

Can you repeat the\n 3  question, please?\n 4    Q  Yes.  Is Intel a corporate\n 5  member of the IEEE?\n 6    A  I don't know what a corporate\n 7  member of IEEE is.  I know there are\n 8  employees at Intel that attend IEEE and a\n 9  significantly contribute to WIFI standard.\n10    Q  And you had mentioned\n11  attending Zoom meetings for IEEE.\n12    Have you participated in\n13  working groups at IEEE?\n14    A  No.\n15    Q  So you haven't participated\n16  in any working groups relating to power\n17  saving or target wait time on behalf of the\n18  company?\n19    A  No.\n20    Q  Do you have any familiarity\n21  with the IEEE's RAND obligation, reasonable\n22  and nondiscriminatory obligation?\n23    MR.

And did you and\n22  Mr. Ben Ari, again, sorry about the last\n23  name, did you review any documents with him?\n24    A  No.\n25    Q  No, okay.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    So you didn't independently\n 3  verify any of the things he was saying?\n 4    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n 5    form.\n 6    A  I didn't.\n 7    Q  Okay.\n 8    A  Can I add, I didn't, but you\n 9  know, I work in the WIFI industry, and I\n10  fully understand all the answers he gave me,\n11  that an AP does not receive beacons and so\n12  on.\n13    All the information that I\n14  provided you for an AP does not receive\n15  Beacon, an AP does not do any transitions\n16  from sleep mode to active mode and so on.\n17    So, I didn't need to go in\n18  and verify that what he told me is correct,\n19  because that's my understanding as well from\n20  my experience in the WIFI system and the\n21  WIFI industry, okay?\n22    Q  Your understanding is that\n23  access points, APs, do not sleep?\n24    A  Access points do not sleep.\n25    Q  Let's move on to Chris Wills,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  what did you and Mr. Wills speak about?\n 3    A  So, about certification\n 4  activities, certification of TWT.  TWT is\n 5  tested in WIFI Alliance under special build\n 6  driver that Intel has.\n 7    Intel does not enable TWT in\n 8  our products, okay?\n 9    We do have the ability to run\n10  the TWT functionality only under a test --\n11  special build driver in test mode, and\n12  that's done only for getting the\n13  certification WIFI Alliance on the TWT\n14  feature.\n15    Again, the TWT feature is not\n16  enabled in our products.\n17    Q  You had mentioned the\n18  drivers.  Does Intel create its own drivers\n19  for various -- for the devices in these WIFI\n20  devices?\n21    A  Yes; correct.",

I think altogether, within more\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  or less two weeks from the time it was\n 3  enabled until the time it was disabled.\n 4  Again, enabled accidentally.\n 5    Q  Okay.\n 6    A  I don't know exactly, okay,\n 7  so, sorry for interrupting you.\n 8    Now, we don't know if at all\n 9  TWT was actually active in any field in the\n10  U.S., for instance.  We don't know where it\n11  was active at all.\n12    We just know that somehow the\n13  activation of TWT, due to that accidental\n14  enablement, it caused many issues, and it\n15  was therefore immediately disabled back.\n16    Q  Okay.  What about Mr. Ben Ami\n17  regarding the Linux operating system.  What\n18  did you guys speak about?\n19    A  So, Golan mentioned also\n20  there was another short period of time where\n21  the Linux driver -- Linux is a very niche\n22  market in our WIFI market, the Linux driver\n23  had TWT enabled because there was an\n24  assumption that TWT was assumed to be stable\n25  in our device testing, in our general device\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  testing, not stable as a whole feature\n 3  working with APs, okay?\n 4    So it was enabled for a very\n 5  short time as a test to see how it can work,\n 6  specifically on the Linux market, because\n 7  the Linux market is, again, a niche market\n 8  and has a very good way to collect bug\n 9  reports from users.\n10    Eventually, or shortly\n11  afterwards, it was again -- we noticed that\n12  TWT introduces a lot of issues with the WIFI\n13  connectivity, throughput and disconnections\n14  and so on.\n15    And therefore was\n16  immediately, immediately disabled again.\n17    Q  Okay.\n18    A  That's what I -- that's what\n19  Golan Ben Ami explained to me.\n20    Q  And you mentioned Mr. Cox.\n21  What did you speak with Mr. Cox about?\n22    A  So, I asked him about product\n23  brief that we have, that I saw, that\n24  suggested maybe the Intel device supports\n25  TWT.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Although I know that the\n 3  decision we had at the time was not to\n 4  support it.\n 5    And he explained to me that\n 6  that document relates to, mainly it's a\n 7  document that relates to the ability to\n 8  certify the device.\n 9    So you need to declare to the\n10  regulatory bodies which features you\n11  currently plan to support.  Not what you\n12  actually support, which features you plan to\n13  support.\n14    So, when you go and want to\n15  enable such a feature, for example, the TWT,\n16  you don't need to redo the whole\n17  certification process, okay?\n18    At the time, as he explained,\n19  at the time that that document was actually\n20  written, the decision was not taken yet to\n21  disable, it was more or less at the same\n22  time, to disable TWT.\n23    It was around 2019, at the\n24  end of the certification, WIFI 6, and there\n25  were no products sold yet by Intel.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    It was just in preparation\n 3  for passing the regulatory testing and so\n 4  on.\n 5    Q  Okay.  Then you had also\n 6  mentioned Mr. Kasbecker.  What did you speak\n 7  with him about?\n 8    A  Just to check and verify what",

HIRSCH:  I'll object,\n19    sir.  You can answer that question\n20    yes or no.\n21    A  Yes.\n22    Q  Who helped you locate those\n23  documents?\n24    MR. HIRSCH:  Hold on, I'll\n25    object to the form.  You can answer,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    sir, if you reviewed any documents\n 3    apart from any meetings that you\n 4    might have had with attorneys.\n 5    A  I reviewed documents apart\n 6  from any meetings I had with any attorney.\n 7    Q  Did you personally find any\n 8  documents that you were reviewing in\n 9  connection with this deposition?\n10    A  Yes.\n11    Q  Okay.  Did you prepare or\n12  review any written notes for today's\n13  deposition?\n14    A  Yes.  So I have notes from my\n15  discussion with Danny Ben Ari on Wave 600.\n16    Q  And you have those today with\n17  you?\n18    A  Yes, I have it here with me,\n19  and that's the notes I took when I spoke\n20  with him about Wave 600, captures his\n21  feedback.\n22    MR. HECHT:  Okay, we would\n23    ask that those are produced.\n24    Q  But I will ask you, are you\n25  relying on any other notes besides those\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  notes that you just identified as you\n 3  testify here today?\n 4    A  No.\n 5    Q  And generally I always ask,\n 6  do you have any other papers around you?  I\n 7  mean.  We are going to ask for those papers\n 8  that you identified to be produced, but\n 9  besides that, are you looking at anything,\n10  do you have any access to anything as you're\n11  testifying here remotely?\n12    A  Here today, you are asking?\n13    Q  Yes.\n14    A  I have in front of me this\n15  one Danny Ben Ari's notes and printed a\n16  version of the patent itself.\n17    Q  Okay.\n18    A  And that's it.\n19    Q  Okay, thank you.\n20    Did you review any source\n21  code in preparation for this deposition?\n22    MR. HIRSCH:  I'll object to\n23    the form.  Counsel, you haven't\n24    established that any documents\n25    refreshed his memory.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Asking him what documents he\n 3    prepared -- he reviewed in\n 4    preparation for the deposition\n 5    outside of that would call for\n 6    privileged information.\n 7    MR. HECHT:  I don't see how\n 8    it's privileged to ask if he looked\n 9    at source code in preparation for\n10    this deposition.\n11    MR. HIRSCH:  Because you\n12    haven't established under Federal\n13    Rule of Evidence 612 that anything\n14    that he reviewed in preparation\n15    refreshed his recollection.\n16    I think you can ask him if\n17    he -- if he has seen source code and\n18    when he's seen source code.\n19    I think the way that you\n20    phrased the question on its face\n21    would call for privileged\n22    information.\n23    MR. HECHT:  I would just ask\n24    to the extent you have an objection,\n25    you can make a standing objection or\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    you can direct him not to answer on\n 3    privilege grounds, but I think I'm\n 4    entitled to ask, so I will ask it\n 5    slightly differently.\n 6    Q  Are you familiar with Intel\n 7  source code relating to target wait time?\n 8    A  Yes, I have reviewed -- I am",

So I finished my army service,\n 6  I started to work as a practical engineer in\n 7  this company, the BAE.\n 8    And about a year later I\n 9  stopped working there and I went to study at\n10  the Coventry University.\n11    Q  I see.  And when you\n12  graduated university, is that when you\n13  started at DSPC?\n14    A  No, I started at DSPC, I\n15  think it was in the third year of my -- of\n16  my studies as a student, in a student\n17  position.\n18    So, meaning it wasn't a\n19  full-time job.  I was working there mainly\n20  on vacations and, you know, on university\n21  vacations and so on.\n22    Q  But eventually you began\n23  working there full-time?\n24    A  And when I finished my -- my\n25  studies, after three years in Coventry\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  University, I worked full-time at DSPC, yes.\n 3    Q  And did any of your work at\n 4  DSPC involve WIFI related technologies?\n 5    A  No, it involved cellular\n 6  protocols.\n 7    Q  Then did you join Intel after\n 8  DSPC?\n 9    A  So, Intel acquired DSPC,\n10  DSPC's cellular business, I think it was in\n11  the year 2000, more or less.\n12    So I was -- I transitioned\n13  into Intel.\n14    Q  Okay.  So you've been at\n15  Intel -- well, you were at Intel from that\n16  point, from its acquisition of DSPC, through\n17  it says 2014?\n18    A  So, yeah, let me --\n19    Q  Sorry, I am misreading,\n20  through 2007?\n21    A  Yes, so Intel acquired DSPC\n22  when I was working there and I became an\n23  Intel employee.\n24    And I worked at Intel for\n25  seven years on cellular wireless\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  communication.\n 3    And at around 2007, Intel\n 4  decided to sell off the cellular business to\n 5  Marvell Technologies, a semiconductor --\n 6  Marvell Semiconductor.\n 7    So I, again, I didn't move.\n 8  I was sold, I guess, the whole division was\n 9  moved to Marvell.\n10    I continued to work on\n11  wireless communication, cellular business\n12  until the year 2015.\n13    Q  Okay.\n14    A  And in 2015 I moved to the\n15  current organization I'm in, working on WIFI\n16  full-time.\n17    Q  So you've been working on\n18  WIFI for about a little over a decade?\n19    A  Yeah, it's going to be 11\n20  years soon, in March.\n21    Q  Congratulations.\n22    So that -- so what is your\n23  current position at Intel?\n24    A  So, I am a principal engineer\n25  at Intel.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    I currently manage the system\n 3  hardware architecture team, and the\n 4  responsible for the data path, which is not\n 5  only hardware, it's also software.\n 6    I am also representing the\n 7  product team in our activity together with\n 8  Intel's standards team and promoting our --\n 9  and promoting Intel's interests into the\n10  standard, the products interest into the\n11  proposed standard.\n12    Reviewing other customers' --\n13  other companies' proposal to the standard\n14  and seeing and providing our feedback on\n15  them or seeing how we need to adopt and so\n16  on, so on.\n17    I'm very -- in my position\n18  I'm also very much involved in the standard\n19  development, within the product team group.\n20    Q  You said before that you're\n21  not part of the standards body, of the IEEE,\n22  but how are you involved, how does that\n23  work?\n24    A  So, the organization has a",

I'm not the\n19  expert in this, in again, the namings, they\n20  change a lot.\n21    But give me a name, I can\n22  probably tell you what it would be.\n23    Q  Yes.  So, some of the\n24  processors we have seen have an H\n25  designation.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Do you know what the H\n 3  processor line designation means?\n 4    A  No; I don't know that.\n 5    Q  Let me see if I can get\n 6  something that could help us.\n 7    MR.

Please take a look at\n19  this document, maybe that can help us\n20  with -- this actually was printed right off\n21  of Intel's website.\n22    But there are still\n23  formatting issues on it, but there are\n24  designations that are indicated here, and I\n25  was specifically asking about the H\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  designation.\n 3    So, if you could take a look\n 4  and let me know.\n 5    A  Okay.\n 6    Q  I guess, first of all, have\n 7  you ever seen this document before, this\n 8  Guide to Processor Naming?\n 9    A  No.\n10    Q  Okay.

This is not in the\n20  area of my expertise, okay?\n21    You have to understand that\n22  the WIFI is part of Intel's Solution -- is\n23  one of many, many essential components in\n24  what Intel actually sells, okay?\n25    So this -- I have no way to\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  tell you if what's here is accurate or not.\n 3  I never saw this.\n 4    It's not in the area of my\n 5  expertise, I'm sorry.\n 6    Q  Well, just, we will see if\n 7  any of this can refresh your recollection.\n 8    Many of us have seen Intel\n 9  processors before, but look at page 4.  And\n10  this shows a chart, it's not the best\n11  formatting, but it shows in the middle\n12  mobile laptop and 2 in 1, and then it shows\n13  H, and H shows highest performance.\n14    Do you know if Intel's H line\n15  of processors are high performance\n16  processors?\n17    A  Again, I can't relate to what\n18  it says in this document.  I can read what\n19  it says here, and what I understand.\n20    I don't know if that's\n21  correct or not.  I see what you're saying, I\n22  see the format, but I can't -- I can't\n23  relate to this.\n24    I didn't write this document,\n25  I'm not familiar with it, with this\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  information, I'm sorry.\n 3    Q  Okay, fair enough.  We can\n 4  move on.\n 5    Do you have more familiarity\n 6  with the WIFI modules that Intel produces?\n 7    A  Over there, yes.\n 8    MR. HIRSCH:  Sir, just make\n 9    sure you wait until his question is\n10    done before you start your answer.\n11    It just makes the record much\n12    cleaner.\n13    A  Sorry for -- yes.\n14    Q  Okay.  So with respect to\n15  WIFI modules, one of the accused products\n16  series is the AX 100 and AX 200.\n17    Do you know what the\n18  difference is between those two series?\n19    A  So, as far as I remember the\n20  code naming is the AX means -- well, that\n21  I'm sure of, the AX means that it's hardware\n22  that supports 802.11 AX standard.\n23    And then there is three\n24  digits.  One of them represents the number\n25  of antennas or receive/transmit chains the\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  device has, one or two.\n 3    And the other one represents\n 4  the generation of that -- of that 11 AX\n 5  products.  We might have multiple products\n 6  from the same -- for the same 802.11 AX.\n 7    And the third one, two\n 8  antennas, one generation, maybe which step,\n 9  I don't remember exactly.\n10    Q  Okay.\n11    A  I don't really use -- this is\n12  the marketing code names for the products,\n13  right?\n14    And it's not really commonly\n15  used within the design team.  More product\n16  level code names.\n17    Q  Do you know, for example --\n18  well, you mentioned AX, meaning 802.11 AX.\n19  Is that marketed by IEEE as WIFI 6?\n20    A  It's marketed by WIFI\n21  Alliance as WIFI 6.  WIFI 6 is WIFI Alliance\n22  naming.\n23    The generations of WIFI was\n24  named by WIFI Alliance, not by IEEE.\n25    In IEEE it's 802.11 AX.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  I see.  So the AX 100 series\n 3  is capable of -- is -- it utilizes 802.11\n 4  AX?\n 5    A  It utilizes -- it follows the",

What is the\n 6  CNVI architecture?\n 7    A  Okay, so the Intel's products\n 8  are platform, when you buy Intel platform,\n 9  as I explained before, it includes multiple\n10  essential technologies, right?\n11    WIFI is only one component of\n12  all of that.\n13    In some, within that\n14  architecture, there is part of the MAC\n15  hardware that's called CNVI, okay?\n16    It's a hardware that cannot\n17  function without any -- without the\n18  additional companion RF chip, what we call a\n19  CRF.\n20    So if you take the main Intel\n21  CPU, the platform itself, and you do not\n22  choose Intel's WIFI solution, you still have\n23  in the device that hardware, but that\n24  hardware cannot do anything, because it has\n25  to have the only Intel's companion RF chip\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  side up to it, right?\n 3    The same hardware that Intel\n 4  provides that includes the CNVI inside, can\n 5  run a third party's WIFI without Intel's\n 6  WIFI at all, okay?\n 7    So that's the CNVI,\n 8  connectivity Intel.  As far as I remember.\n 9    Q  Got it.  You mentioned MAC\n10  hardware.  What does that mean?\n11    A  The MAC, the MAC protocol in\n12  WIFI is very complex and requires low\n13  latency and high throughput, and there is\n14  accelerating hardware to handle that part of\n15  the protocol.\n16    Q  Okay.  And you had asked\n17  about an example when I was talking about\n18  odd versus even.\n19    One example we have in mind,\n20  the AX 210 module versus the AX 211.\n21    Do you know the difference\n22  between those two?\n23    A  So again, I don't remember\n24  the exact places of each digit.  It may be\n25  in the next generation of that, of that next\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  step or generation of that product, or one\n 3  of them is a SISO, or another one is a MIMO,\n 4  or something like that.\n 5    Again, I can't really comment\n 6  on that.\n 7    Q  Now, the WIFI modules, do\n 8  those plug into the bus of the computer,\n 9  like PCIE?\n10    A  It depends.  So, Intel offers\n11  two flavors of WIFI.  One of them is called\n12  Integrated Solution, using the CNVI hardware\n13  I explained before.\n14    So, in order for that device\n15  to do any, transmit or receive over the air,\n16  you need to connect the companion RF chip to\n17  the CNVI.\n18    The interface physically goes\n19  over an M.2 slot in your laptop, right?\n20    Q  Um-hum.\n21    A  But the actual physical",

    "core_text": "19  over an M.2 slot in your laptop, right?\n20    Q  Um-hum.\n21    A  But the actual physical\n22  interface is a proprietary and high speed\n23  serial interface developed by Intel; okay?\n24    And even if you connect all\n25  those together, you just take Intel's CRF,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  connect it to that M.2 slot, you still don't\n 3  get any WIFI functionality from the product\n 4  unless you connect, again, antennas.\n 5    You need to connect, you need\n 6  the OS to support that hardware, you need to\n 7  install the driver, and so on and so on.\n 8    It's a whole system you need\n 9  to build around the Intel platform in order\n10  to get any functionality that transmits or\n11  receives over WIFI.\n12    Q  Okay.\n13    When I was referring to --\n14  you were mentioning the system, focusing\n15  more on, say, like the AX 210.\n16    I just wanted to clarify some\n17  nomenclature.  I think I referred to it's a\n18  WIFI module.\n19    Is it also fair to describe\n20  it as a WIFI adaptor or network card?\n21    A  It depends who you ask.\n22    So, how I see it, okay.\n23  That's only my personal view, right, other\n24  people might disagree with me.\n25    So again, I said Intel has an\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  Integrated Solution using the CNVI, right,\n 3  the MAC is in the hardware, is in the\n 4  platform.\n 5    And we have a companion RF\n 6  chip doing the fine RF to do -- you need to\n 7  connect the antennas to do any transmission\n 8  or reception.\n 9    There is another flavor of\n10  WIFI that we provided that is called\n11  discrete solution, okay.\n12    And that solution hooks up\n13  into the same M.2 interface, but the\n14  interface itself is a PCIE, as you asked\n15  before.\n16    And the MAC hardware that's\n17  in Intel's platform within the discrete\n18  solution is running on the actual, what I\n19  call now a NIC.\n20    It's an interface card.  It\n21  has both the MAC and the fine RF within one\n22  module that you need to buy.\n23    Now, even if you buy this NIC\n24  and connect it over PCIE into an Intel\n25  platform, right, you still won't get any\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  WIFI activity with transmitting or receiving\n 3  unless you again connect antenna to that\n 4  NIC, install the driver, and update the OS\n 5  and so on to support, to work with Intel's\n 6  WIFI.\n 7    So you need all that in order\n 8  to get any activity.\n 9    So, you can call it -- it's a\n10  fair question.  You can call it a NIC, you\n11  can call it a network adaptor.\n12    The question is who you're\n13  asking.  There is no real agreement about\n14  that.  It's not a standard definition for\n15  that.\n16    Q  Okay.  And what did you mean\n17  by the MAC is in the platform?\n18    A  So, maybe the platform is not\n19  the correct word.\n20    When you buy a CPU, one of\n21  the generations that you showed earlier in\n22  that document, okay, the hardware, it has a\n23  part, which is the main CPU, doing all the\n24  processing that your laptop, for example,\n25  does.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    And another part in the\n 3  hardware that handles auxiliary activity,\n 4  out of which one of them, there is a whole\n 5  lot of different accelerators and so on\n 6  within that lower part that's usually called\n 7  PCH.\n 8    And WIFI is just one\n 9  component in there that handles the WIFI.\n10  So you would have, besides the WIFI there,\n11  for example, just for example, right, camera\n12  handling, microphones, recording, sensing,\n13  stuff like that, memory access and hard\n14  drives, USB, whatever.\n15    All what's not the main CPU,\n16  will be part of the lower, the lower part of\n17  the architecture, Intel's solution, right?\n18    And the MAC is in there, the\n19  MAC -- and again, that MAC works only if you\n20  take the CRF solution that Intel provides.\n21    If you take the discrete\n22  solution, that MAC sits there and does\n23  nothing.\n24    Q  I see, that's helpful.\n25    I'm going to have another\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  document in a second.\n 3    MR. HECHT:  So this next\n 4    exhibit you will want to download,\n 5    because it's in Excel.\n 6    (The above described document was\n 7    marked Exhibit 4 for identification as of\n 8    this date.)\n 9    Q  So, if you could open Exhibit\n10  4.  This is Intel PROX 00604815.\n11    Q  This appears to be a record\n12  or application for certification.  Have you\n13  seen this document before, or documents like\n14  it?\n15    A  Like, it I think so.  This",

They configure the TWT\n16  by themselves.\n17    It's not at all anything like\n18  what happens in a real device, where the\n19  whole control and environment and\n20  configuration comes from the AP or from\n21  the -- from the network, from the device.\n22    It's a special test mode,\n23  again, under a special driver build that\n24  tests TWT.\n25    Yeah.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  Do you have something else to\n 3  add?

    "core_text": " 2    Q  Do you have something else to\n 3  add?  Sorry.\n 4    A  I'm just saying, so our\n 5  intention -- I don't know what time, what\n 6  date this was produced, this document,\n 7  right?\n 8    But in general, we, again, do\n 9  not support TWT in our products in the\n10  field.  That was our decision after we saw\n11  that the performance of TWT is catastrophic\n12  for user experience, right?\n13    We disabled it.  But we still\n14  want to allow our device to enable it if\n15  these issues are ever resolved.\n16    It might never be resolved,\n17  okay, but we don't want to pass the\n18  certification process and then say okay,\n19  your device does not support certification\n20  for TWT, and then we cannot enable it if we\n21  ever want to enable it.\n22    So that's the reason that you\n23  see this was set to yes, because we can pass\n24  the test, again, only if we use the special\n25  build driver.  That's not the driver that\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  runs in the field.\n 3    The driver that runs in the\n 4  field does not enable TWT.\n 5    Q  Okay, I think maybe I solved\n 6  the mystery of what the both means.  If you\n 7  click on that cell, it says 2.4 gigahertz, 5\n 8  gigahertz, both or neither.\n 9    So would you agree with me\n10  that both seems to refer to both of those\n11  frequencies?\n12    A  Yeah, it totally makes sense\n13  that the answer is on which of the bands\n14  that you see up in row 21, 22, probably that\n15  means that you support TWT both on 5, so it\n16  should be all three.\n17    So where is the 6, where did\n18  you see that note?\n19    Q  If you just click the cell,\n20  are you in Excel, or is it just --\n21    A  I need to enable editing, one\n22  second.\n23    So, it's very weird that they\n24  don't have the option of a 6 gigahertz.\n25    So maybe this, unless maybe\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  you declare that you are not supporting 6\n 3  gigahertz.  Where do you declare?\n 4    So if I add, for example, in\n 5  row 22, I change it to 1, now if I pull down\n 6  the both, it will still be?\n 7    No, I don't know.  I don't\n 8  know why it's both.  But as you see, you\n 9  have three bands up and only an option to\n10  select 2 on the side there.\n11    Q  Well, do you see -- look at\n12  cell, or what is this row, 22, there it says\n13  band selection, it shows 2.4 gigahertz, 5\n14  gigahertz and 6, but it's showing 0 for\n15  transmit and receive at 6 gigahertz?\n16    A  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree,\n17  but what -- I even tried to change the 6 to\n18  1, and the both doesn't change to be all\n19  three.\n20    Do you see what I'm saying?\n21    So, there is no way to select\n22  the 6 gigahertz, so that I don't know.  I\n23  didn't write this Excel.  I'm not sure what\n24  this both means, I'm sorry.\n25    And you see, for example,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  also, if you go to 53, row 53, you have 2.4\n 3  plus 5.\n 4    Q  Actually, if you go to, if\n 5  you go to row 46, at column E and F, that\n 6  shows, it says TWT supported for 6\n 7  gigahertz, and that says no.\n 8    A  Correct.\n 9    Maybe because the device\n10  doesn't support 6 gigahertz at all, because\n11  you see on the top it's zero in row 22, it's\n12  configured to zero.\n13    Q  Do you happen to know if the\n14  AX 101 supports 6 gigahertz?\n15    A  I don't remember, I'm sorry.",

HIRSCH:  Give me time to\n21    object.  I object to the form.  You\n22    can answer, just give me time, sir.\n23    A  Yes, my understanding of\n24  this, and again, I didn't write this, but\n25  this is defining a configuration for a\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  device that does not support 6 gigahertz,\n 3  based on what I see here in row 22, columns\n 4  C and D.  But again, I might be mistaken.\n 5    Q  I think we also looked at the\n 6  WIFI certified 6 means WIFI 6.\n 7    Maybe this was before WIFI 6E\n 8  that had 6 gigahertz?\n 9    A  It could be.\n10    Q  Okay.  Next question, well, I\n11  guess we were also looking at the both, at\n12  row 43.\n13    If you click on that cell,\n14  F43, it says announced, unannounced or both.\n15    Do you know what that means?\n16    A  I know what announced and\n17  unannounced activity means.  That is a part\n18  of the standard.\n19    Again, I don't know what the\n20  both is relating to here, sorry.\n21    A  The announced and unannounced\n22  activity is just another mode of operation\n23  of TWT.\n24    Q  And at row 56, this shows,\n25  the heading says \"Additional Tests\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  Required,\" that's at row 52.\n 3    A  But then underneath it it\n 4  says, so, \"Additional tests required for\n 5  WIFI 6, release 2,\" and then at row 56 it\n 6  says, \"Broadcast TWT 2.4 gigahertz and 5\n 7  gigahertz.\"\n 8    What does that mean?\n 9    A  So, WIFI Alliance divided the\n10  WIFI 6 into two releases.  There was release\n11  1 and release 2.\n12    First set of features\n13  included in what's called release 1, and\n14  later on they added additional features to\n15  what's called release 2.\n16    That's normally what the WIFI\n17  Alliance do.\n18    And the broadcast disability,\n19  which is another mode of TWT in the\n20  standard, was added to release 2.\n21    Q  Maybe we can move to another\n22  page, actually.  The sheet on the bottom\n23  that says WIFI 6 STAUT?\n24    A  Correct, I see it.\n25    Q  And I'm looking, feel free to\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  take a look at the document, but when you do\n 3  peruse through, I'm looking to get to row\n 4  133.\n 5    A  Okay.\n 6    Q  And that says STAUT,\n 7  individual TWT test, and it shows in columns\n 8  D and E mandatory, and then result, pass.\n 9    What does this mean?\n10    A  It means -- I'm not sure what\n11  the mandatory here means, because as far as\n12  I know, it's an optional feature, TWT.\n13    Maybe it means -- it says\n14  you're mandatory because -- I don't know,\n15  because you set -- because it was set as\n16  supported in the previous page.\n17    It means that this was\n18  tested, again, it was tested under a special\n19  driver build of Intel for the certification\n20  only.\n21    It's not enabled, TWT is not\n22  enabled in the field.\n23    And when testing TWT under\n24  the special software version build for the\n25  certification only, the test passed.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  Is there anything in any of\n 3  these documents about this special driver\n 4  that you are referring to?\n 5    MR.

I didn't write\n14  this spreadsheet, I don't know.\n15    I don't know, sorry.\n16    Q  Where does your knowledge or\n17  Intel's knowledge of this special driver,\n18  where does that come from?\n19    Because you mentioned that\n20  several times now about a special driver.\n21    A  Okay.  So again, I spoke with\n22  Chris, he's the guy that runs the\n23  certification activity, and WIFI Alliance,\n24  they actually have a certified lab as well\n25  so he can certify the device running these\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  tests.\n 3    He configures our device into\n 4  test mode, he writes the scripts for testing\n 5  them, and he knows that, as he explained to\n 6  me, that he needs to take a special driver\n 7  build in order to run the TWT.\n 8    And that he cannot take the\n 9  normal, you know, driver that's out there\n10  the market and run these tests, because TWT\n11  does not support -- is not supported in the\n12  field in Intel's devices, okay?\n13    So he needs to take a special\n14  driver, special driver build, configure it\n15  into test mode, and only then he can run\n16  these tests.\n17    Q  So, I guess what's a little\n18  confusing is what did -- so what is the\n19  purpose of obtaining certification based on\n20  a test driver that's never being utilized?\n21    Does that happen elsewhere?\n22  Have you seen that before?\n23    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n24    form.\n25    A  You need to understand that\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  the context of this activity is in WIFI\n 3  Alliance.  It's part of the technology\n 4  development.\n 5    It's not certifying what the\n 6  device actually supports in the field, okay?\n 7    And again, for TWT, we wanted\n 8  to participate in technology development,\n 9  because again, we believed TWT might have\n10  value.\n11    And as I said earlier, we saw\n12  that TWT doesn't give the promised value in\n13  the field, and thus it was disabled in\n14  Intel's devices.\n15    But just for the activity of\n16  the TWT testing, certification testing, we\n17  enabled it in order to allow us to have the\n18  ability to later on enable it in the field\n19  if we see that this -- that the issues with\n20  TWT in the field are resolved.\n21    We are not there yet.  TWT is\n22  not enabled in the field, I will say that\n23  again.\n24    And here, in WIFI Alliance,\n25  since we are taking, we still want to run\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  TWT, but it can't run on our normal driver\n 3  because it doesn't support TWT, right?\n 4    So we need some special\n 5  configuration and special build, just to get\n 6  the activity to run, that's the reason.\n 7    Q  Do you know who relies on\n 8  these certifications?\n 9    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n10    form.\n11    A  I don't know; I'm sorry.\n12    Q  Do you know the purpose of\n13  the certifications?\n14    A  The purpose of the\n15  certification is to make sure that when WIFI\n16  is deployed, a new program in WIFI is\n17  deployed, you can be sure that when you buy,\n18  for example, an access point that was\n19  developed by Qualcomm or Broadcom and you\n20  buy a laptop that developed, the Intel\n21  developed the WIFI on, you will get the\n22  expected experience, and won't see any\n23  issues in the field with the product.\n24    So it's an interoperability\n25  testing, to verify in general, that's the\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  main reason for it, to verify that, you\n 3  know, you have a product that was tested\n 4  with all the WIFI in the world.\n 5    It's very surprising that\n 6  when you go to a hotel and turn on your\n 7  laptop or phone, it actually works.\n 8    But you never know that one\n 9  side developed the phone and another side\n10  developed the access point and suddenly they\n11  work together, no one tested that before?\n12    So that's the main reason of\n13  WIFI Alliance.\n14    So you want to see that any\n15  feature that you have in your code -- it\n16  doesn't mean you enable it in the field,\n17  okay, any feature that you developed in your\n18  code is actually working with the other\n19  side, with the AP.\n20    That's the reason we certify\n21  this.  It has value for anyone that wants to\n22  buy a device that has passed WIFI Alliance\n23  certification.\n24    As far as I know, almost all\n25  the companies that sell WIFI in the world,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  that respect themselves, pass through the\n 3  certification process.\n 4    Because otherwise, I said,\n 5  before you encounter many issues when trying\n 6  to connect to any other WIFI peer if it's\n 7  not your own company's solution, right?\n 8    That's the main reason for\n 9  this certification.\n10    Q  So, in other words, the\n11  certification is about compatibility between\n12  different manufacturers' devices?\n13    MR. HIRSCH:  Old on.  I\n14    object to the form.  You can answer.\n15    A  In general, yes.  It's taking",

It's taking\n16  the standard and saying okay, let's see if\n17  we are able to do something about the\n18  standard, so actually defining and seeing if\n19  it can work in a specific test that's under\n20  a specific configuration that's agreed by\n21  the parties that are testing it, okay.\n22    It doesn't mean the feature\n23  is going to work in the field.\n24    Q  Where does it -- I think you\n25  keep qualifying --\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    A  I just wanted to add, the\n 3  fact that you passed certification does not\n 4  mean that that feature is going to be\n 5  functional or going to work in the field.\n 6    So, even if you pass a test,\n 7  and even if you enable a feature, and again,\n 8  TWT was not enabled in our devices, but any\n 9  other test, if you pass a test, it doesn't\n10  mean that in the field it's going to work.\n11    It just means higher chances,\n12  that if you choose to enable that feature,\n13  it's going to work better than if you just\n14  first time try it in the market, okay?\n15    That's the value of the\n16  certification program.\n17    Q  But how does another party\n18  looking at a certification know what might\n19  be only a result of special drivers and what\n20  is always there?\n21    MR.

What is that?\n11    A  Broadcast TWT is another --\n12  it's a flavor of TWT in the standard, where\n13  the AP actually broadcasts the TWT\n14  configuration, and the station can choose if\n15  it wants to participate in this TWT or not.\n16    So it's kind of dictated by\n17  the AP.\n18    AP broadcasts to all the\n19  stations, this is my TWT configuration.

Again, I'm repeating that\n24  this functionality that I described is not\n25  supported by Intel's products.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  So with respect to, you\n 3  mentioned the service period.  Is that also\n 4  called the wake period?\n 5    A  It could be, I'm not sure.\n 6    Q  Okay?  Is it fair to say that\n 7  Target Wait Time provides scheduled sleep\n 8  potentially?\n 9    A  No.  I wouldn't call it that\n10  way, no.\n11    Q  And you had mentioned the AP\n12  and the station, right?\n13    Just to be clear, what is the\n14  AP?\n15    A  The AP is the access point,\n16  or some people call it also a router, and\n17  the station is -- okay.\n18    Q  You were actually about to\n19  answer my question.\n20    A  And the station, and the\n21  station is what the device has, what the\n22  WIFI that you have in your phone, in your\n23  laptop, in any device, right, it's not\n24  hooked up to the wall, on the wall into\n25  the -- it's usually a battery powered\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  device.\n 3    Q  So like a laptop would be a\n 4  station?\n 5    A  A laptop, a cell phone, yeah,\n 6  so on, tablet.\n 7    Q  Does TWT, the functionality,\n 8  improve battery life?\n 9    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n10    form.\n11    A  TWT intentionally was to\n12  allow, maybe to improve power.  It depends\n13  how you operate it.\n14    Actually what we saw in the\n15  field, that it doesn't improve power, it's\n16  the opposite.\n17    It reduces -- it makes higher\n18  power consumption, because the protocol is\n19  not complete and working properly, so it\n20  doesn't.\n21    In the field, or in the\n22  testing, not in the field, in the testing\n23  that we have done on TWT, we see that it\n24  actually causes our station to get to higher\n25  power consumption than when not testing on\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  TWT.\n 3    Q  Did Intel test the TWT\n 4  functionality before attempting to get its\n 5  products certified in TWT?\n 6    A  No.\n 7    Q  When did Intel find out that\n 8  TWT was actually having this opposite\n 9  effect?\n10    A  So around 2019, that more or",

    "core_text": " 8  TWT was actually having this opposite\n 9  effect?\n10    A  So around 2019, that more or\n11  less at the end of the WIFI Alliance\n12  certification program, where we -- where the\n13  TWT was tested on that special driver\n14  version that was just for testing it, right,\n15  not enabled in the field.\n16    Around that time we continued\n17  to do some in-house testing on a special\n18  version that supports TWT to see if it has\n19  real issues.\n20    And on that special testing\n21  version, actually the same version that's\n22  run by WIFI Alliance, we saw that the APs do\n23  not support what's expected in order to\n24  allow TWT to be a power saving feature.\n25    Q  If you look at the Deposition\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  Exhibit folder, I've uploaded Exhibit 6,\n 3  which is labeled Intel PROX 00339798.\n 4    (The above described document was\n 5    marked Exhibit 6 for identification as of\n 6    this date.)\n 7    A  I need to download the PDF,\n 8  sorry.\n 9    It a big file, I guess.  17\n10  megs, yeah.  Okay, it's only this one.\n11    Q  It was just the first page.\n12  It was produced this way, or we extracted it\n13  this way?\n14    Do you know who Leo Oram is?\n15    A  System engineer.  He used to\n16  work at Intel.  He left like five years ago,\n17  something like that.\n18    Q  You worked with him?\n19    A  Yes.\n20    Q  In this presentation, which\n21  presumably is about, it says Power\n22  Management, Power Save Overview.  That's the\n23  title of the presentation.\n24    Have you ever seen this\n25  presentation before?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    A  I can't be sure about that.\n 3  I don't know.\n 4    Q  Can you turn to page 18?\n 5    A  Page 18, yes.\n 6    Q  So, this says, \"TWT-11 AX\n 7  Target Wait Times, TWT, allow STAs to manage\n 8  activities in the BSS by scheduling STAs to\n 9  operate at different times in order to\n10  minimize contention and to reduce the amount\n11  of time that an STA utilizing a power\n12  management mode needs to be awake.\"\n13    Is that accurate?\n14    MR. HIRSCH:  Sorry, are you\n15    asking whether he read it or whether\n16    the statement is accurate?\n17    MR. HECHT:  Whether the\n18    statement is accurate.\n19    A  So, you need to understand\n20  the context of this document and who wrote\n21  it and where this sentence is coming from,\n22  okay?\n23    So, Leo Oram was in our\n24  system architecture team.  We have different\n25  domain owners, okay?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Leo Oram was the owner of the\n 3  power domain in our team, okay?\n 4    When TWT was introduced into\n 5  the standard, we had to decide which of the\n 6  domain audits needs to handle the TWT, the\n 7  definition, the first system, who the system\n 8  engineer is going to look into TWT.\n 9    As I said before, we have --\n10  we see value for TWT for many other features\n11  that don't relate at all to power save,\n12  okay?\n13    That's not the first priority\n14  feature at all for us in TWT.\n15    And as I explained earlier,\n16  we actually saw in the field that -- not in\n17  the field, again, in the test version that\n18  we did, we saw that when enabling TWT the\n19  power consumption becomes worse than when\n20  not enabling it, okay?\n21    So now let me explain the\n22  context that I'm trying to get to.\n23    So when Leo Oram presented\n24  this Power Point, just from the template, I\n25  know it's very early, and I said he also\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  left like five years ago.\n 3    He was presenting the concept\n 4  from how he sees this feature as the TWT --\n 5  as the power domain owner, okay, he saw that\n 6  for his domain it can give value, okay?\n 7    Is that the main purpose of\n 8  TWT in Intel's view?  The answer is no; not\n 9  power.\n10    Q  Okay, fair enough.\n11    MR. HECHT:  Hold on one\n12    second.  I'm going to mark another\n13    exhibit.\n14    (The above described document was\n15    marked Exhibit 7 for identification as of\n16    this date.)\n17    MR. HECHT:  My Explorer\n18    crashed.  These PDFs are big, as you\n19    said.\n20    Give me a second.  Do you\n21    have Adobe on your computer?\n22    Because we might have to\n23    shift.  The reason I ask is this one\n24    has the problem throughout the\n25    document of the incorrect\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    orientation.\n 3    A  I do have.

So I'm\n 4  going to ask you to open, refresh the\n 5  Deposition Exhibit folder, open up Exhibit\n 6  7, and this is marked Intel_PROX_0039271.\n 7    And this one you are going --\n 8    A  I am downloading it.\n 9    Do you remember the shortcut?\n10  Wait a minute, I'm not in the PDF.\n11    MR. HIRSCH:  That little\n12    arrow there.\n13    It's not the PDF, it's not\n14    Adobe.  Oh, just this one.  Try that\n15    one, yes.\n16    Well, I got it.\n17    Q  Just as long as you're able\n18  to read it, that's all I care about.\n19    A  It's in front of me now, in\n20  the right orientation.\n21    Q  This is a presentation that's\n22  titled 802.11 AX-OR/AG/WIFI 6 Production,\n23  and this credits you, Danny Alexander, June\n24  2020.\n25    Do you remember this\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  presentation?\n 3    A  I know that guy, nice guy.\n 4    Do I remember?  You know,\n 5  over my years at Intel I did so many\n 6  presentations.  I don't remember through the\n 7  title.\n 8    If I skip through a few more.\n 9    Q  Why don't you take your time\n10  to take a look at the document, because I\n11  will have some --\n12    A  Give me some time.\n13    Q  Sure.\n14    A  It looks like an overview\n15  that I gave to the -- to the development\n16  teams about the new features that we have in\n17  WIFI 6 as a preparation for what we are\n18  going to develop.\n19    It's not an overview of our\n20  products.  It doesn't describe our products'\n21  behavior.\n22    Again, I don't know, if you\n23  see here, for example, TWT, it doesn't mean\n24  that our product supports TWT, it just means\n25  at the time I prepared this Power Point,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  which, again, was a preparation for\n 3  developing the standard.\n 4    The system team that I'm in\n 5  works on these things way before the guys\n 6  that actually implement them do it.\n 7    And sometimes you don't even\n 8  know if all these features went into a\n 9  product or not.\n10    So even if you see TWT\n11  mentioned here, it doesn't mean it was\n12  implemented in the device.\n13    It just means that at the\n14  time WIFI 6 content in IEEE included TWT, if\n15  that's your question.\n16    I don't know if I was going\n17  too fast.\n18    So this is an overview\n19  document, you see, introduction, in June\n20  2020 in WIFI 6.\n21    Q  Okay.\n22    And you're exactly right, it\n23  does mention TWT.  So your colleague's\n24  description of it, and if you could turn to\n25  page 34, this was in the presentation that\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  you authored, and take a look at the\n 3  statements regarding Target Wait Time.\n 4    MR. HIRSCH:  He said 34.\n 5    Q  Page 34?\n 6    A  Yes.\n 7    Q  If you could review this page\n 8  and just let me know if anything is not\n 9  accurate.\n10    A  This is accurate in the\n11  context of only this slide.\n12    So I will refer you to, go,\n13  please, to slide number 35, next one.\n14    Q  Yes.\n15    A  And you will see, so maybe\n16  the first one was relating to power, okay?\n17    And again, this was my\n18  overview of the feature of TWT.  I was not\n19  the owner.\n20    I am, at the time I was\n21  leading the WIFI 6 in a high -- not in high\n22  level, overall, looking at all the features,\n23  right?\n24    So in each feature there is\n25  an owner, specific owner, okay?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    So, you see in slide 34 I\n 3  mention it can have value for power, right?\n 4    In slide 35, I show there is\n 5  a totally different use doing scan.  Scan is\n 6  not when the station is in power save with\n 7  TWT.\n 8    So station is doing a scan\n 9  activity with the TWT.\n10    So, in the context of slide\n11  34, yes, it's relating to the option that\n12  TWT can save power.\n13    And again, I'm going to say\n14  that what we saw actually, that TWT does not\n15  save power, it's the opposite, it makes the\n16  power consumption worse, okay?\n17    In slide 35, I'm relating to\n18  scan example, and I can tell that you in\n19  TWT, we have more use cases that do not\n20  relate to power saving, but they relate to\n21  the ability of the station to know when it\n22  needs to be available working with the AP,\n23  on the TWT basis, and to know when it's\n24  capable to do other activity over the\n25  channel.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    As I said before, it can be\n 3  scan, it can be ranging, it can be sensing,\n 4  any other activity that our device can do,\n 5  but doesn't need to do with the AP, okay?\n 6    This all obviously didn't\n 7  happen in the product, because it is not\n 8  enabled in the field.\n 9    Q  Do you recall any\n10  presentation that you gave where you had\n11  articulated what you're saying here today\n12  that effectively TWT is not very good?\n13    A  No, not off my head, no.",

Moving on to a\n15  different topic, I think we lightly touched\n16  on this before, but what is OFDMA?\n17    A  OFDMA, we are talking all\n18  frequency division multiplexing access.\n19    It allow the AP -- you want\n20  further?\n21    Q  Yeah, just not -- at a high\n22  level?\n23    A  It allows the AP to partition\n24  the operating bandwidth into what's called\n25  resource units, allocating to each station a\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  different resource unit.\n 3    It's not a time slot, it's a\n 4  resource unit.\n 5    Meaning you get a specific\n 6  area in the frequency domain and you operate\n 7  on that frequency domain only.\n 8    So it allows multiple\n 9  stations to operate simultaneously on a\n10  single AP's operating bandwidth.\n11    Q  So yeah, in other words,\n12  OFDMA involves many devices transmitting at\n13  the same time?\n14    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n15    form, outside the scope of the\n16    30(b)(6) notice.\n17    You can answer, sir.\n18    Q  Same question.\n19    OFDMA allows, in OFDMA\n20  multiple devices are transmitting at the\n21  same time?\n22    MR. HIRSCH:  And same\n23    objections.  It's outside the scope\n24    of the 30(b)(6) notice.  It's not\n25    accused.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Counsel, are you going to ask\n 3    what's at issue?  Why are we asking\n 4    about functionality.\n 5    MR. HECHT:  We are getting to\n 6    it.  OFDMA has a relationship with\n 7    TWT, so I am getting to it.\n 8    We don't need speaking\n 9    objections, please.\n10    MR. HIRSCH:  You can answer,\n11    sir.\n12    A  So, repeat the question\n13  again, please?\n14    Q  In OFDMA are multiple devices\n15  transmitting at the same time?\n16    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n17    form.\n18    A  In OFDMA multiple devices can\n19  transmit at the same time.\n20    An AP can transmit to\n21  multiple devices or multiple devices can\n22  receive at the same time.\n23    Q  And OFDMA, I think you talked\n24  about frames.  Is OFDMA using something\n25  called trigger frames?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    A  OFDMA has a concept of\n 3  trigger frames as well.\n 4    Q  And do you know if trigger\n 5  frame polls are the PCs or stations that are\n 6  awake for the data that they have to send?\n 7    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n 8    form.\n 9    A  I don't understand your\n10  question.  Can you please say it in a\n11  different way so I can understand what\n12  you're trying to say?\n13    Q  Yeah.  So with respect to the\n14  trigger frames, the trigger frames can\n15  involve stations or computers that are awake\n16  and are polled when they have data to send,\n17  is that accurate?\n18    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n19    form.\n20    A  Again, I think you're making\n21  up something, right?\n22    There is no connection, real\n23  connection between a trigger frame and a\n24  station needing to be awake; no direct\n25  connection for that.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  But does the trigger frame\n 3  ask the STA to transmit the BSR?\n 4    MR.

Okay, yeah.\n13    Q  Have you seen this document\n14  before?\n15    A  I don't know.\n16    I know the guy who wrote it.\n17    Q  And who is Shaul Trabitz?\n18    A  He's a software/firmware\n19  engineer in the WIFI team.\n20    Q  And you looked through the\n21  document to see if you've seen this before?\n22    A  I don't recall seeing it\n23  before.\n24    Q  Well, this has been produced\n25  in this litigation, and I'll direct your\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  attention to page 3.\n 3    A  Yeah, okay.  Now I think I\n 4  did, actually did maybe see it.\n 5    It relates to a report that\n 6  was given about an issue that was -- saying\n 7  the whole day that TWT doesn't work in the\n 8  field and has real issues.\n 9    So this report here is\n10  explaining the issues that we saw, that we\n11  saw with TWT.  That's my understanding.\n12    So which slide did you want\n13  me to look at?\n14    Q  Page 3?\n15    A  Page 3.\n16    Q  And do you know when this\n17  report would have been drafted?  Because you\n18  mentioned seeing it.  Do you remember when\n19  you saw it?\n20    A  No, I can't remember.\n21    Q  Do you remember if it was in\n22  the last two years?\n23    A  I was looking at the slide\n24  with the issues that it said there.\n25    Where was it?  The\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  technical -- the local reproduction, okay.\n 3  So this rings a bell that I probably have\n 4  seen this before, yes.\n 5    You see, \"However, the\n 6  degradation was observed\" --\n 7    Well, the bullet there,\n 8  \"However, some throughput degradation was\n 9  observed.  This might be due to known bug in\n10  BSR reporting.\"\n11    So, as far as I remember,\n12  this relates to the issues that we are\n13  seeing at the time that TWT was initially\n14  tested, I think.\n15    I don't know when this\n16  document was originally produced, no.\n17    Q  I think you're looking at\n18  slide 5.\n19    A  I am at slide 5, yes, now.\n20  Sorry I didn't tell you.\n21    Q  If you look at the lower\n22  right of slide 5, it mentions CR OS build, I\n23  believe that's Chrome OS build, and then it\n24  says R137.\n25    Do you recall that that\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  Chrome OS build is from this year R137?\n 3    A  It could be.  There was a",

There was a\n 4  case where accidentally TWT was enabled, I\n 5  mentioned this earlier today, right?\n 6    There was a case where\n 7  accidentally TWT was enabled in the product\n 8  due to an error, a bug that one of the\n 9  software engineers did when in the process\n10  of releasing the software version.\n11    He forgot to disable it, or\n12  if he didn't do the actual action that needs\n13  to be done to disable it, that's what we do\n14  for every release, because TWT is not\n15  enabled in our products.\n16    So, in this specific release,\n17  as far as I remember, or maybe it wasn't\n18  this spencific, because I don't remember the\n19  number, but there was a case earlier this\n20  year where the Chrome OS had TWT enabled for\n21  a very short time due to an accidental\n22  enablement by the driver team.\n23    And as I said earlier today,\n24  in that case we saw, we got report from\n25  Google that they are saying a catastrophic\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  behavior of the WIFI.\n 3    And we immediately identified\n 4  it's because of this error or bug that\n 5  someone by mistake enabled TWT, and it was\n 6  disabled immediately.\n 7    So this report from Shaul is\n 8  likely following that occasion to say what\n 9  he saw here, yeah.\n10    Q  Do you know if Chrome OS had\n11  TWT enabled?\n12    A  Again, Chrome OS had TWT\n13  enabled due to a bug, due to a\n14  catastrophic -- a bug in the release process\n15  where it was enabled by mistake just for two\n16  weeks, okay?\n17    Then Google came to us and\n18  said there is issues with the WIFI not\n19  working correctly, and we immediately\n20  identified that it's because of this\n21  accidental enablement of TWT, and we\n22  immediately went and disabled TWT.\n23    Q  So you can remotely --\n24    A  Maybe two weeks.  And sorry\n25  for interrupting you, I'm sorry.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    And in those two weeks, we\n 3  don't even know how much time TWT was\n 4  actually working, if at all, in the field,\n 5  and if it was working in the U.S. or\n 6  anywhere else.\n 7    There is no way to know that,\n 8  right?\n 9    But we just know when it was\n10  enabled by mistake, it actually showed what\n11  we thought, that TWT cannot work good in the\n12  field, and that's what this actual accident\n13  showed us, right?\n14    And then we immediately\n15  disabled TWT again.\n16    Q  So on page 5, this says,\n17  \"Analysis.  Our observations show that the\n18  flow worked as expected.\"\n19    Do you see that?\n20    A  Yes, I see that.\n21    Q  What does that mean?\n22    A  I mean, I don't know what\n23  he's saying here, I don't know.\n24    I didn't write this.  I'm\n25  sorry, I don't know what exactly the\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  observations are he's talking about.\n 3    I just see that he says that\n 4  there were issues with TWT that I know that\n 5  we are expecting to see.\n 6    Q  On page 7 in the conclusions,\n 7  it says, \"This seems to be an AP misbehave\n 8  based on the data provided.\"\n 9    Do you know what that means?\n10    A  It is my understanding that",

HIRSCH:  I object to the\n16    form.\n17    A  We did not -- TWT is not\n18  enabled on any of our products, okay, in any\n19  OS, not in Linux, not in Windows, on Chrome\n20  OS today, to start, okay?\n21    On Windows we never even by\n22  mistake enabled TWT.  So I can't even answer\n23  this question.  I don't know if it works.\n24    It did, Windows only passed\n25  certification testing, again, under a\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  special driver in WIFI Alliance.\n 3    The specific test that WIFI\n 4  Alliance has defined for TWT, it did not\n 5  work in the field, never.\n 6    Q  You had mentioned fixing the\n 7  problem.\n 8    How was the problem fixed\n 9  with respect to Chrome OS?\n10    MR. HIRSCH:  I object to the\n11    form.\n12    A  Which problem are you talking\n13  about?  What slide, I'm sorry?  The\n14  misbehavior problem, that's not our problem,\n15  that's a problem on the AP side.\n16    Are you relating to that?\n17    Q  Well, you had said in your\n18  testimony that when you found out that there\n19  was a bug, I think you put it, steps were\n20  taken to correct that.\n21    What steps were taken?\n22    A  What I understand from\n23  discussion with Guy Ben Ari about the\n24  specific instance is they added quite a few\n25  measures in order to assure that that cannot\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  happen again.\n 3    So, the release process\n 4  includes quite a few checks and steps that\n 5  can't allow TWT to be enabled in the field.\n 6    Not even by mistake.  That\n 7  happened before.  That can't happen anymore,\n 8  because there is multiple checks that need\n 9  to -- and actually even deleted some of the\n10  code there, so that you can't even enable it\n11  if you try to enable it by mistake, or\n12  someone changes like one line in the code,\n13  maybe, that won't even enable the TWT, okay?\n14    Q  Are you referring to changes\n15  in the drivers?\n16    A  In the drivers, yes.",

In the\n20  driver and the release process there is\n21  configuration for how to build a driver and\n22  so on.\n23    So, the configuration there\n24  is assuring that there is no way for the\n25  Chrome OS to enable the viability.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    We even got the request from\n 3  Google, they don't want to see TWT in the\n 4  field, because they saw the issues that it\n 5  produced over that instance, right?\n 6    So, the very hard blocking in\n 7  the driver configuration and code, so that\n 8  it cannot operate TWT in the field.\n 9    Q  But getting back to sort of\n10  what I have labeled as the fix, and the\n11  driver updates, so what happens when Intel\n12  updates the drivers, what happens from\n13  there?\n14    Are those sent automatically\n15  to the Chrome OS computers?\n16    A  I don't know how that release\n17  works.\n18    Q  Okay.\n19    A  I don't even know if, by the\n20  way, if the issue that Google saw was on an\n21  official release or Google saw it in their\n22  own release, and then it was -- and then it\n23  was returned to us.\n24    So I don't even know if that\n25  version went out to the market.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  Okay.\n 3    If you want, because I have a\n 4  different line of questioning with some more\n 5  exhibits, I don't think I'm going to take\n 6  the full day, and I know that we started\n 7  late, but I do have some more questions.\n 8    Do you want to break for\n 9  lunch now and come back at like 1:20 or\n10  something like that?\n11    MR.

And the Harrison\n 4  peak basically covers all the RF, you see\n 5  the two front RF front and the FE on the\n 6  right side there?\n 7    And the two lines coming out\n 8  of there, those are the antennas that\n 9  actually need to be connected in order for\n10  the device to do anything.\n11    So when you buy Harrison peak\n12  from -- when you choose, when a customer\n13  chooses to use WIFI based on Intel's WIFI\n14  connectivity solution, okay, he will buy\n15  Harrison peak.\n16    He will then need to connect,\n17  in order for it to work at all, he will need\n18  to connect the Harrison peak into its\n19  platform, obviously.\n20    He would need to connect the\n21  antennas to the series and install it, so\n22  on, so on.\n23    Then Harrison peak will start\n24  to do any activity.  Without that, Harrison\n25  peak as a stand-alone, as you see, doesn't\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  even have the MAC part with it, right?\n 3    So Harrison as a stand-alone\n 4  cannot do any receive/transmit whatsoever in\n 5  the WIFI protocol, okay?\n 6    So this is a high level\n 7  description.  If anything else is\n 8  interesting for you, I can try to --\n 9    Q  Do you know if these two, if\n10  the PCH and the module are sold together?\n11    A  I am -- I think I'm not the\n12  person to answer that, okay?  Just because I\n13  don't know, okay?\n14    But just to, as I said\n15  before, that you can buy a laptop that has\n16  Intel platform, Intel CPU, and the WIFI\n17  solution is not Intel based, meaning someone\n18  connected to the M.2, I don't know, Broadcom\n19  based,  Qualcomm based WIFI, and that's not\n20  Intel based WIFI.\n21    This hardware on the left\n22  side is still there, it's just like, you\n23  know, a dead piece of hardware.\n24    It cannot do anything, it's\n25  disabled, or not even disabled.  It's not\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  powered up or anything.\n 3    So, if that kind of answers\n 4  your question, then --\n 5    Q  Well, you also mentioned the\n 6  phrase powered up.\n 7    For any of this, either side,\n 8  to do anything, this needs power, right?\n 9    A  No, none of us, no electronic\n10  works without power, right?\n11    Q  Sure.  All WIFI needs power.\n12  Fair to say?\n13    A  Any electronic -- well, I'm\n14  talking about wireless communication, needs\n15  power somehow, right?\n16    Q  Is it also fair to say, you\n17  know -- you brought our attention to the\n18  WIFI MAC purple box.\n19    That contains something\n20  called MAC logic?\n21    A  Correct.\n22    Q  And that -- okay.\n23    Does the MAC logic include\n24  instructions for Target Wait Time?\n25    MR.

You need to define what it\n 5  means, okay?\n 6    Are you talking about the\n 7  hardware itself does not know at all or do\n 8  anything at all related to TWT.\n 9    To be clear, TWT is not\n10  enabled in our products, right?  It's not\n11  enabled in the field.\n12    But the hardware that you see\n13  here, the purple block, does not do anything\n14  related to TWT, okay?\n15    The hardware itself, it's\n16  done by a driver or software, it's done by a\n17  firmware and so on.\n18    There is no dedicated\n19  hardware doing TWT.\n20    Q  So there is nothing, there is\n21  no instructions for TWT in the WIFI MAC\n22  purple box at all is what you're saying?\n23    A  What do you mean instructions",

So I'll rephrase\n10    my question.\n11    Q  In preparation for this\n12  deposition did you learn for the first time\n13  that TWT was not enabled?\n14    A  A strong no.  TWT is not\n15  enabled in the field, a strong no, okay?\n16    I was part of the people that\n17  decided, and to find that TWT should not be\n18  enabled because it has issues, okay?\n19    The total decision from the\n20  project management, it came to me, together\n21  with the other TWT guys, owners, and we said\n22  guys, we can't enable TWT in the field, it\n23  has issues.\n24    We have to disable it, okay?\n25  And that was a decision took, that we took\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  way back in 2019.\n 3    Any case you saw TWT working\n 4  on any Intel device out of certification,\n 5  put aside the certification, special driver,\n 6  was only based on a bug, okay?\n 7    A bug, or as I said earlier,\n 8  a Linux specific build to specific niche\n 9  market, just to see if we were able to get\n10  it to do anything.\n11    And as I explained earlier,\n12  very early, after we disabled it again,\n13  because we saw what we suspected we would\n14  see, which is TWT has issues in the field\n15  and doesn't work good.\n16    It's disabled, that's not\n17  coming from any -- I didn't speak with\n18  anyone about that, I know this for a few\n19  years.\n20    Q  And you -- look, this sounds\n21  very serious, because what I'm wondering, is\n22  there any place where this decision to\n23  eliminate TWT is documented?\n24    A  Not that I know of.",

And at any point did\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  Intel, who is a member of IEEE, ever tell\n 3  IEEE this TWT is a real problem and has\n 4  terrible performance?\n 5    A  Okay, so let me explain how\n 6  things work.\n 7    So, the standard developed\n 8  TWT, okay?\n 9    The WIFI Alliance decided\n10  okay, what parts of TWT we want to test?\n11  That's the test you showed in the previous\n12  documents, right?\n13    Those tests were able to\n14  pass.  In order to get TWT to work in the\n15  field, you need the AP and the station to do\n16  a certain amount of sequences in a specific\n17  flow and to do it based on what should be\n18  done for the device to work properly, right?\n19    So, for example, if you\n20  expect in TWT the AP to give you, to send\n21  the station a specific frame within a TWT\n22  certain period and it doesn't do that,\n23  because the AP decided or for some reason\n24  they have a bug or they want to operate\n25  differently or so on, then it won't work in\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  the field.\n 3    That's exactly the issues.\n 4    So it's not that we need to\n 5  change the standard, it's that we need to\n 6  work with the industry, with all the\n 7  industry across the industry, outside of\n 8  WIFI Alliance, to get TWT to work.\n 9    That's something that we have\n10  been trying to do for quite a while, and\n11  it's not succeeding, okay, that's why TWT is\n12  disabled.\n13    You might succeed,  I said it\n14  earlier, we might succeed sometime in the\n15  future, we might not.\n16    But as TWT today, as we see\n17  it, it's the feature, that's not stable, it\n18  gives worse performance for users, and\n19  that's why it's disabled in all Intel\n20  platforms, platforms, on all Intel devices,\n21  on all the OS's.\n22    Q  Did you participate or do you\n23  have any knowledge of Intel's participation\n24  in discussions with the IEEE regarding these\n25  current issues with Target Wait Time?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    A  Again, these current issues\n 3  with Target Wait Time are real, what we call\n 4  real life issues.\n 5    They are not standards\n 6  missing definitions, right?\n 7    By the way, there are others,\n 8  some other, I would say improvements or\n 9  enhancements that Intel is involved in\n10  adding to the standard over the years that\n11  relate to TWT.\n12    But that's only IEEE.  It's\n13  just saying okay, if we ever are able to\n14  resolve those issues that we currently see\n15  with TWT, and that's the reason why we\n16  disabled it, if we are ever able to enable\n17  TWT, so there are additional features that\n18  we can, additional enhancements to TWT that\n19  can be done, then maybe make it work better\n20  or better resolve those other issues we\n21  spoke about and so on, okay?\n22    It's all under IEEE.  I mean,\n23  that's under IEEE, okay, enhancing the TWT.\n24    But resolving the issues that\n25  we currently or that currently cause us to\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  disable TWT, that's not IEEE.\n 3    So we didn't -- we don't, I\n 4  mean I don't speak for IEEE, but I think if\n 5  there is an issue, I think AP should do\n 6  this.\n 7    It's not written in the\n 8  standard to that's why TWT is not working.\n 9    Then I approach the Intel\n10  guys that work on the standard and they\n11  would try to promote it.\n12    That's not the case for why\n13  TWT is disabled here, okay?\n14    Q  Okay.\n15    We were talking about the\n16  enabling and disabling of TWT via register.\n17    Is there any way that the\n18  driver, Intel's drivers can be utilized to\n19  enable or disable the register and therefore\n20  TWT?\n21    A  I don't know, I don't know, I",

I can't talk about\n20  it too much.\n21    I know what -- I understand\n22  what it's trying to show, but I can't talk\n23  about it too much, it's not my expertise.\n24    Q  Let's look at the -- let's\n25  see if you can help.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Let's look at the upper\n 3  right.

I can't relate specifically\n22  to what it has here, but if you are asking\n23  in relation to TWT, I'm going to repeat it\n24  again.\n25    TWT is not enabled in our\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  features, so anything in this diagram\n 3  related to TWT is out of any context, okay?\n 4  It's not functional there.\n 5    MR.

One is called\n20  discrete with a full MAC, and FI\n21  capabilities are within the WIFI adapter,\n22  external to Intel's overall platform\n23  solution.\n24    And if the customer chooses\n25  Intel WIFI, he needs to connect that device\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  into an Intel based platform.\n 3    The other one uses an\n 4  integrated MAC, where the hardware of the\n 5  WIFI MAC is part of the, what's it called,\n 6  the PCH part of the Intel architecture.\n 7    And in both, okay, so in the\n 8  integrated MAC option, you cannot do any\n 9  WIFI, that hardware doesn't do anything as\n10  long as you don't have a wireless CRF\n11  connected to the platform, right?\n12    So the hardware is sitting\n13  there, but it's powered off, because there\n14  is no -- it doesn't have the companion RF\n15  chip that it needs, it doesn't have a driver\n16  and so on.\n17    It's just like dead hardware\n18  within the chip.\n19    Q  Now, when the Intel\n20  processors are used with integrated MAC\n21  adapter, is the WIFI functionality\n22  integrated into the processor core or the\n23  PCH?\n24    A  The WIFI MAC functionality is\n25  integrated is part of the PCH.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  And when the Intel processors\n 3  are used with the discrete WIFI adapter,\n 4  what portion of the processor is involved\n 5  with performing WIFI functionality?\n 6    A  In a hardware level, no\n 7  portion.  The processor only hosts the\n 8  driver.\n 9    So the CPU is running the\n10  software driver that controls the overall\n11  WIFI, not the hardware that relates to WIFI.\n12    Q  Now, how, sticking with the\n13  processors for a moment, sir, how, if at\n14  all, are the Intel processors at issue in\n15  this case sold with wireless transceivers?\n16    MR.

HECHT:  Objection to\n12    form.\n13    A  Actually, if you go to, for\n14  the cases of Chrome where TWT was enabled\n15  for a very short time, and for Linux\n16  similarly, you can actually go to the\n17  version control of the driver code, it's\n18  public driver code, it's open source.\n19    And look into the chain, the\n20  text describing the changes that were put\n21  into the software, and you will actually see\n22  there that that was a bug and TWT should be\n23  disabled.\n24    So, in that sense it's\n25  documented there.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  Okay, so let's break that\n 3  down for a moment.\n 4    With respect to the Chrome\n 5  driver code, that's public or not?\n 6    A  The Chrome driver code is\n 7  public.\n 8    Q  And what information is there\n 9  in the public Chrome driver code as to\n10  whether Intel implements TWT?\n11    A  So, you can see in the text\n12  describing the bug fix that TWT is being\n13  disabled.\n14    You can see the actual code\n15  the bit in the H extended capability reports\n16  that tells the AP that the station supports\n17  TWT.\n18    So in the fix, you can see\n19  that was removed, actually removed.  Instead\n20  of reporting in the bug, it was reported\n21  that it was set to 1.\n22    That line is deleted, and\n23  basically the report to the AP is indicating\n24  a zero, meaning the station is not\n25  supporting TWT after that fix.\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    Q  Okay.  And turning to the\n 3  Linux code, is that public or not public?\n 4    A  Linux code is public.\n 5    Q  And in that public Linux\n 6  code, what information is there about\n 7  whether TWT is enabled or disabled?\n 8    A  So, it's very similar.\n 9  Basically the code for, that handles TWT, is\n10  similar between Chrome and Linux.\n11    You see similarly that the\n12  Linux driver code that handles the HE\n13  extended capability report, that includes\n14  TWT requester capability field, is set to 0.\n15    Q  Two more questions, sir.\n16    Have you heard of future\n17  channel guidance?\n18    A  I have heard of it.  We don't\n19  support that feature and I can't say\n20  anything else about it.\n21    Q  That was my last question,\n22  sir.\n23    When, if ever, has Intel\n24  enabled future channel guidance for its\n25  products?\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2    A  Never.  Again, we don't\n 3  support that feature.\n 4    MR. HIRSCH:  Thank you, sir.\n 5    No further questions.\n 6    MR.

And does Intel have\n12  any evidence that TWT wasn't enabled for\n13  users in the United States in connection\n14  with the Chrome incident?\n15    A  I don't know, I can't answer\n16  that.  What I do know is that when it was\n17  enabled for just two weeks, immediately it\n18  exposed so many issues that we identified as\n19  bugs and disabled it, right.\n20    So if for some reason it was\n21  enabled, and again, it's not enabled.  At\n22  least Intel is not enabling it, right?\n23    For some reason, you say\n24  theoretically, it was enabled, I truly\n25  believe that it would crash or get worse\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  performance and we would know about that\n 3  very shortly about after that.\n 4    So as we saw it in this bug\n 5  with Google, right?\n 6    Q  How would, what would crash\n 7  as a result of TWT being turned on?\n 8    A  Customers would be\n 9  complaining, low throughput, latency,\n10  disconnections, stuff like that, bad WIFI\n11  experience.\n12    Q  Right.  But okay, that's bad\n13  WIFI experience but that is something\n14  different than a crash?\n15    A  Okay, maybe I have my words\n16  -- but for me, that's a crash, right?  Our\n17  WIFI solution is what we call best in class.\n18    If you don't get what we call\n19  the promised throughput and the latency and\n20  so on because there is some feature that's\n21  killing it, that's a crash for our\n22  engineering, right?\n23    For a user, it's a bad\n24  experience.  It's a bad WIFI experience.\n25    You have latency problems,\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n\n 1    DANIEL ALEXANDER\n 2  lower throughput, you download a file, it\n 3  takes you three times longer, or maybe will\n 4  disconnect in the middle of downloading a\n 5  file and you need to redownload it, stuff\n 6  like that; okay?\n 7    Q  And okay, I think that's all\n 8  I have.\n 9    MR.
