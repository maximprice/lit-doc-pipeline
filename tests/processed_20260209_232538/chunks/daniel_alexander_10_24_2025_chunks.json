Do you understand that Intel has designated you to speak for the company on certain topics subject to certain objections?\n\nA      I understand that, yes.\n\nQ      Okay.\n\nAnd did you review a number of topics, the topics you were designated on, before this deposition?\n\nA      I saw -- I saw the patent that's being talked about a while back already.\n\nQ      Okay.\n\nPage 11",
