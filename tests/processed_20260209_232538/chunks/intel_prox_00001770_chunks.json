It supports a uniform set of frame formats and exchange sequences that QSTAs may use during both the contention period (CP) and the contention-free period (CFP).\n\n3.137 hybrid coordinator (HC): A type of coordinator, defined as part of the quality of service (QoS) facility, that implements the frame exchange sequences and medium access control (MAC) service data unit (MSDU) handling rules defined by the hybrid coordination function (HCF). The HC operates during both the contention period (CP) and contention-free period (CFP). The HC performs bandwidth management including the allocation of transmission opportunities (TXOPs) to QoS stations (QSTAs). The HC is collocated with a QoS access point (QAP).\n\n3.138 hybrid coordination function (HCF) controlled channel access (HCCA): The channel access mechanism utilized by the hybrid coordinator (HC) to coordinate contention-free media use by quality of service (QoS) stations (QSTAs) for downlink unicast, uplink, and direct-link transmissions.\n\n3.139 link: In the context of an IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) entity, a physical path consisting of exactly one traversal of the wireless medium (WM) that is used to transfer an MAC service data unit (MSDU) between two stations (STAs).\n\n3.140 non-access point (non-AP) quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA): A station (STA) that supports the QoS facility, but is not an access point (AP). A non-AP QSTA does not have an hybrid coordinator (HC) and uses the QoS AP (QAP) for the distribution system services (DSSs).\n\n3.141 non-quality of service (non-QoS) access point (nQAP): An access point (AP) that does not support the quality of service (QoS) facility.\n\n3.142 non-quality of service (non-QoS) basic service set (nQBSS): A basic service set (BSS) that does not support the quality of service (QoS) facility.\n\n3.143 non-quality of service (non-QoS) station (nQSTA): A station (STA) that does not support the quality of service (QoS) facility.\n\n3.144 parameterized quality of service (QoS): The treatment of the medium access control (MAC) protocol data units (MPDUs) depends on the parameters associated with the MPDU. Parameterized QoS is primarily provided through the hybrid coordination function (HCF) controlled channel access (HCCA) mechanism, but may also be provided by the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism when used with a traffic specification (TSPEC) for admission control.\n\n3.145 piggyback: The overloading of a data frame with an acknowledgment of a previously received medium access control (MAC) protocol data unit (MPDU) and/or a poll to the station (STA) to which the frame is directed.\n\n3.146 prioritized quality of service (QoS): The provisioning of service in which the medium access control (MAC) protocol data units (MPDUs) with higher priority are given a preferential treatment over MPDUS with a lower priority. Prioritized QoS is provided through the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism.\n\n3.147 quality of service (QoS) access point (QAP): An access point (AP) that supports the QoS facility specified in this amendment. The functions of a QAP are a superset of the functions of a non-QAP (nQAP), and thus a QAP is able to function as an nQAP to non-QoS stations (nQSTAs).\n\n3.148 quality of service (QoS) basic service set (QBSS): A basic service set (BSS) that provides the Qos facility. An infrastructure QBSS contains a QoS access point (QAP).\n\n3.149 quality of service (QoS) facility: The set of enhanced functions, channel access rules, frame formats, frame exchange sequences and managed objects used to provide parameterized and prioritized QoS.\n\n3.150 quality of service (QoS) independent basic service set (QIBSS): An independent basic service set (IBSS) in which one or more of its stations (STAs) support the QoS facility.\n\n3.151 quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA): A station (STA) that implements the QoS facility. A QSTA acts as an non-QSTA (nQSTA) when associated in a non-QoS basic service set (nQBSS).\n\n3.152 scheduled service period (SP): The SP that is scheduled by the quality of service (QoS) access point (QAP). Scheduled SPs start at fixed intervals of time.\n\n3.153 service period (SP): A contiguous time during which one or more downlink unicast frames are transmitted to a quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA) and/or one or more transmission opportunities (TXOPs)\n\nare granted to the same QSTA. SPs can be scheduled or unscheduled. For a non-access point (non-AP) QSTA, there can be at most one SP active at any time.\n\n3.154 service interval (SI): The interval between the start of two successive scheduled service periods (SPs).\n\n3.155 traffic category (TC): A label for medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) that have a distinct user priority (UP), as viewed by higher layer entities, relative to other MSDUs provided for delivery over the same link. Traffic categories are meaningful only to MAC entities that support quality of service (QoS) within the MAC data service. These MAC entities determine the UP for MSDUs belonging to a particular traffic category using the priority value provided with those MSDUs at the MAC service access point (MAC_SAP).\n\n3.156 traffic classification (TCLAS): The specification of certain parameter values to identify the medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) belonging to a particular traffic stream (TS). The classification process, performed above the MAC service access point (MAC_SAP) at a quality of service (QoS) access point (QAP), uses the parameter values for a given TS to examine each incoming MSDU and determine whether this MSDU belongs to that TS. TCLAS may also occur at non-access point (non-AP) QoS station (QSTA) with multiple streams. However, such classification is beyond the scope of this amendment.\n\n3.157 traffic identifier (TID): Any of the identifiers usable by higher layer entities to distinguish medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) to MAC entities that support quality of service (QoS) within the MAC data service. There are 16 possible TID values; 8 identify TCs, and the other 8 identify parameterized TSs. The TID is assigned to an MSDU in the layers above the MAC.\n\n3.158 traffic specification (TSPEC): The quality of service (QoS) characteristics of a data flow to and from a non-access point (non-AP) QoS station (QSTA).\n\n3.159 traffic stream (TS): A set of medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) to be delivered subject to the quality of service (QoS) parameter values provided to the MAC in a particular traffic specification (TSPEC). TSs are meaningful only to MAC entities that support QoS within the MAC data service. These MAC entities determine the TSPEC applicable for delivery of MSDUs belonging to a particular TS using the TS identifier (TSID) value provided with those MSDUs at the MAC service access point (MAC_SAP).\n\n3.160 traffic stream identifier (TSID): Any of the identifiers usable by higher layer entities to distinguish medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) to MAC entities for parameterized quality of service (QoS) [i.e., the traffic stream (TS) with a particular traffic specification (TSPEC)] within the MAC data service. The TSID is assigned to an MSDU in the layers above the MAC.\n\n3.161 transmission opportunity (TXOP): An interval of time when a particular quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA) has the right to initiate frame exchange sequences onto the wireless medium (WM). A TXOP is defined by a starting time and a maximum duration. The TXOP is either obtained by the QSTA by successfully contending for the channel or assigned by the hybrid coordinator (HC).\n\n3.162 trigger-enabled access category (AC): A non-access point (non-AP) quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA) AC where frames of subtype QoS Data and QoS Null from the non-AP QSTA that map to the AC trigger an unscheduled service period (SP) if one is not in progress.\n\n3.163 transmission opportunity (TXOP) holder: A quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA) that has either been granted a TXOP by the hybrid coordinator (HC) or successfully contended for a TXOP.\n\n3.164 uplink: A unidirectional link from a non-access point (non-AP) station (STA) to an access point (AP).\n\n3.165 unscheduled service period (SP): The period that is started when a non-access point (non-AP) quality of service (QoS) station (QSTA) transmits a trigger frame to the QoS access point (QAP).\n\n3.166 user priority (UP): A value associated with an medium access control (MAC) service data unit (MSDU) that indicates how the MSDU is to be handled. The UP is assigned to an MSDU in the layers above the MAC.\n\nEnd of changes to Clause 3.",

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"6.1 Overview of MAC services\"]\n\nChange the heading and text of 6.1.1 as follows:\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nThis service provides peer LLC entities with the ability to exchange MSDUs. To support this service, the local MAC uses the underlying PHY-level services to transport an MSDU to a peer MAC entity, where it will be delivered to the peer LLC. Such asynchronous MSDU transport is performed on a best-effort connectionless basis. By default, MSDU transport is on a best-effort basis. However, the QoS facility uses a traffic identifier (TID) to specify differentiated services on a per-MSDU basis. The QoS facility also permits more synchronous behavior to be supported on a connection-oriented basis using TSPECs. There are no uarantees that the submitted MSDU will be delivered successfully. Broadcast and multicast transport i art of the-asvnchronous data service provided by the MAC. Due to the characteristics of the wireles medium (WM), broadcast and multicast MSDUs may experience a lower QoS, compared to that of unicast MSDUs. All STAs will support the asynchronous data service, but only OSTAs in a OBSS differentiate their MSDU delivery according to the designated traffic category or traffic stream (TS) of individual MSDUs\n\nBecause operation of certain functions of the MAC may cause reordering of some MSDUs, as discussed in more detail below, in nQSTAs, there are two service classes within the asynchronous data service. By selecting the desired service class, each LLC entity initiating the transfer of MSDUs is able to control whether MAC entities are or are not allowed to reorder those MSDUS.\n\nThere are two service classes available in a OSTA: QoSAck and QoSNoAck. The service classes are used to signal if the MSDU is to be transmitted with or without using the MAC-level acknowledgment.\n\nIn QSTAs either associated in a QBSS or having membership in a QIBSS, the MAC uses a set of rules that tends to cause higher UP MSDUs in a BSS to be sent before lower UP MSDUs in the BSS. The MAC sublayer entities determine the UPs for MSDUs based on the TID values provided with those MSDUs. If a ing an MSDU to an nOSTA, the OSTA uses the access category (AC) corresponding to the UP of the MSDU.\n\nInsert after 6.1.1 the following subclauses (6.1.1.1 through 6.1.1.3):",

If both the Fixed and Size subfields are set to 0, then the nominal MSDU size is unspecified.\n\nFigure 46tk—Nominal MSDU Size field\n\n814\n\n815\n\nFixed\n\nSize\n\nBits:\n\nThe Maximum MSDU Size field is 2 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the maximum size, in octets, of MSDUs belonging to the TS under this TSPEC.\n\nThe Minimum Service Interval field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the minimum interval, in microseconds, between the start of two successive SPs.\n\nThe Maximum Service Interval field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the maximum interval, in microseconds, between the start of two successive SPs.\n\nThe Inactivity Interval field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the minimum amount of time, in microseconds, that may elapse without arrival or transfer of an MPDU belonging to the TS before this TS is deleted by the MAC entity at the HC.\n\nThe Suspension Interval field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the minimum amount of time, in microseconds, that may elapse without arrival or transfer of an MSDU belonging to the TS before the generation of successive QoS(+)CF-Poll is stopped for this TS. A value of 4 294 967 295 (= 232 - 1) disables the suspension interval, indicating that polling for the TS is not to be interrupted based on inactivity. The value of the suspension interval is always less than or equal to the inactivity interval.\n\nThe Service Start Time field is 4 octets and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the time, expressed in microseconds, when the SP starts. The service start time indicates to QAP the time when a non-AP QSTA first expects to be ready to send frames and a power-saving non-AP QSTA will be awake to receive frames. This may help the QAP to schedule service so that the MSDUs encounter small delays in the MAC and help the power-saving non-AP QSTAs to reduce power consumption. The field represents the four lower order bytes of the TSF timer at the start of the SP. If APSD subfield is set to 0, this field is also set to 0 (unspecified).\n\nThe Minimum Data Rate field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the lowest data rate specified at the MAC_SAP, in bits per second, for transport of MSDUs belonging to this TS within the bounds of this TSPEC. The minimum data rate does not include the MAC and PHY overheads incurred in transferring the MSDUs.\n\nThe Mean Data Rate® field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the average data rate specified at the MAC_SAP, in bits per second, for transport of MSDUs belonging to this TS within the bounds of this TSPEC. The mean data rate does not include the MAC and PHY overheads incurred in transferring the MSDUs.\n\nThe Peak Data Rate field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the maximum allowable data rate, in bits per second, for transfer of MSDUs belonging to this TS within the bounds of this TSPEC. If p is the peak rate in bits per second, then the maximum amount of data, belonging to this TS, arriving in any time interval [t1,12], where t1 < 12 and 12 - t1 > 1 TU, does not exceed p * (12 - t1) bits.\n\nThe Burst Size field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the maximum burst, in octets, of the MSDUs belonging to this TS that arrive at the MAC_SAP at the peak data rate. A value of 0 indicates that there are no bursts.\n\nThe Delay Bound field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the maximum amount of time, in microseconds, allowed to transport an MSDU belonging to the TS in this TSPEC, measured between the time marking the arrival of the MSDU at the local MAC sublayer from the local MAC_SAP and the time of completion of the successful transmission or retransmission of the MSDU to the destination. The completion of the MSDU transmission includes the relevant acknowledgment frame transmission time, if present.\n\nThe Minimum PHY Rate field is 4 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the desired minimum PHY rate to use for this TS, in bits per second, that is required for transport of the MSDUs belonging to the TS in this TSPEC?.\n\nThe Surplus Bandwidth Allowance field is 2 octets long and specifies the excess allocation of time (and bandwidth) over and above the stated application rates required to transport an MSDU belonging to the TS in this TSPEC. This field is represented as an unsigned binary number and, when specified, is greater than 0. The 13 least significant bits (LSBs) indicate the decimal part while the three MSBs indicate the integer part of the number. This field takes into account the retransmissions, as the rate information does not include retransmissions. It represents the ratio of over-the-air bandwidth (i.e., time that the scheduler allocates for the transmission of MSDUs at the required rates) to bandwidth of the transported MSDUs required for successful transmission (i.e., time that would be necessary at the minimum PHY rate if there were no errors on the channel) to meet throughput and delay bounds under this TSPEC, when specified. As such, it should be greater than unity. A value of 1 indicates that no additional allocation of time is requested\n\nThe Medium Time field is a 16-bit unsigned integer and contains the amount of time admitted to access the medium, in units of 32 us/s. This field is reserved in the ADDTS Request frame and is set by the HC in the ADDTS Response frame. The derivation of this field is described in K.2.2. This field is not used for controlled channel access.\n\n&The mean data rate, the peak data rate, and the burst size are the parameters of the token bucket model, which provides standard terminology for describing the behavior of a traffic source. The token bucket model is described in IETF RFC 2212 [B20], IETF RFC 2215 [B21], and IETF RFC 3290 [B23].\n\nThe UP, Minimum Data Rate, Mean Data Rate, Peak Data Rate, Burst Size, Minimum PHY Rate, and Delay Bound fields in a TSPEC element express the QoS expectations requested by a non-AP QSTA, if this TSPEC was issued by that non-AP QSTA, or provided by the HC, if this TSPEC was issued by the HC, when these fields are specified with nonzero values. Unspecified parameters in these fields as indicated by a zero value indicate that the non-AP QSTA does not have specific requirements for these parameters if the TSPEC was issued by that non-AP QSTA or that the HC does not provide any specific values for these parameters if the TSPEC was issued by the HC.",

It is set to O otherwise. The TSID subfield is as defined in 7.1.3.5.1 and indicates the TSID for which this schedule applies. The Direction subfield is as defined in 7.3.2.28 and defines the direction of the TSPEC associated with the schedule. The TSID and Direction subfields are valid only when the Aggregation subfield is set to O. If the Aggregation subfield is set to 1, the TSID and Direction subfields are reserved.\n\nThe Service Start Time field is 4 octets and indicates the anticipated time, expressed in microseconds, when service starts and represents the lower order 4 bytes of the TSF timer value at the start of the first SP. The QAP uses this field to confirm or modify the service start time indicated in the TSPEC request.\n\nThe Service Interval field is 4 octets and indicates the time, expressed in microseconds, between two successive SPs and represents the measured time from the start of one SP to the start of the next SP.\n\nThe Specification Interval field is 2 octets long and contains an unsigned integer that specifies the time interval, in TUs, to verify schedule conformance.\n\nThe HC may set the Service Start Time field and the Service Interval field to 0 (unspecified) for nonpowersaving STAs.",

      "A STA sends a protected STAKey Request message to the AP with the MAC address of the peer STA. On reception of a STAKey Request message, the AP verifies that the received Key Replay Counter field value is equal to or larger than its local copy of the counter. It then verifies that the MIC is valid and sets the local Key Replay Counter field value for the initiating STA to the received value.

A multiple frame transmission within the TXOP occurs when an EDCAF retains the right to access the medium following the completion of a frame exchange sequence, such as on receipt of an ACK frame.",

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"9.9.2.2.1 NAV operation during a TXOP\"]\n\n1'The TID value in the QoS Control field of a QoS Datat CF-Poll frame pertains only to the MSDU or fragment thereof in the Frame Body field of that frame. This TID value does not pertain to the TXOP limit value and does not place any constraints on what frame(s) the addressed QSTA may send in the granted TXOP.\n\naddress in the TA field in the RTS frame matches the saved TXOP holder address, then the QSTA shall send the CTS frame after SIFS, without regard for, and without resetting, its NAV. The saved TXOP holder address shall be cleared when the NAV is reset or when the NAV counts down to 0.\n\nWhen a QSTA receives a frame addressed to it and requires an acknowledgment, it shall respond with an ACK or QoS +CF-Ack frame independent of its NAV. A non-AP QSTA shall accept a polled TXOP by initiating a frame exchange sequence independent of its NAV.\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nA TXOP obtained by receiving a QoS (+)CF-Poll frame uses the specified TXOP limit consisting of one or more frame exchange sequences with the sole time-related restriction being that the final sequence shall end not later than the TXOP limit. In QoS CF-Poll and QoS CF-Ack+CF-Poll frames, the TID subfield in the QoS Control field indicates the TS for which the poll is intended. The requirement to respond to that TID is nonbinding, and a QSTA may respond with any frame. Upon receiving a QoS (+)CF-Poll frame, a non-AP QSTA may send any frames, i.e., QoS data frames belonging to any TID as well as management frames in the obtained TXOP. MSDUs may be fragmented in order to fit within TXOPs.\n\nThe QoS CF-Poll frames shall be sent only by an HC. Non-AP QSTAs are not allowed to send QoS (+)CFPoll frames. Non-AP QSTAs shall not send QoS (+) Data frames in response to any data frame other than the QOS (+)CF-Poll frames.\n\nIf a QSTA has set up at least one TS for which the Aggregation subfield in the associated TSPEC is set to 0, the QAP shall use only QoS CF-Poll or QoS CF-Ack+CF-Poll frames to poll the QSTA and shall never use QoS (+)Data+CF-Poll to poll the QSTA. It should be noted that although QoS (+)CF-Poll is a data frame, but it should be transmitted at one of the rates in the BSS basic rate set in order to set the NAV of all QSTA that are not being polled (see 9.6). If a CF-Poll is piggybacked with a QoS data frame, then the MSDU may be transmitted at the rate that is below the negotiated minimum PHY rate.\n\nQSTAs shall use QoS data frames for all MSDU transfers to another OSTA. The TID in the QoS Control fields of these frames shall indicate the TC or TS to which the MPDU belongs. Furthermore, either the Queue Size subfield shall indicate the amount of queued traffic present in the output queue that the QSTA uses for traffic belonging to this TC or TS, or the TXOP Duration Requested subfield shall indicate the duration that the QSTA desires for the next TXOP for traffic belonging to this TC or TS. The queue size value reflects the amount on the appropriate queue not including the present MPDU. A non-AP QSTA that wishes to inform the HC of queue status may use the QoS Null frame indicating the TID and the queue size or TXOP duration request (also see 9.9.2.3.1).\n\nQSTAs shall be able to receive QoS +CF-Ack frames. The HC may use QoS Data+CF-Ack frames to send frames to the same non-AP QSTA a SIFS after receiving the final transmission of the previous TXOP. The HC may also use QoS Data+CF-Ack frames to send frames to any other non-AP QSTA a SIFS after receiving the final transmission of the previous TXOP, if the non-AP QSTA that sent the final transmission of the previous TXOP has set the Q-Ack subfield in the QoS Capability information element in the (Re)Association Request frame to 1. In both CFP and CP, QSTAs shall always respond to QoS data frames having the Ack Policy subfield in the QoS Control field set to Normal Ack with an ACK frame, unless the acknowledgment is piggybacked in which case it shall use a QoS +CF-Ack frame. Piggybacked frames are allowed only in CFP or within TXOPs initiated by the HC. The HC shall not send a QoS data frame containing a +CF-Ack with an Address 1 that does not correspond to the address of the QSTA for which the +CF-Ack is intended, unless the QSTA to which the +CF-Ack is intended, sets the Q-Ack subfield in the QoS Capability information element in the (Re)Association Request frame. QSTAs are not required to be able to transmit QoS data frames with subtypes that include +CF-Ack.\n\nA QAP that has dotl1QACKOptionImplemented true may allow associations with STAs advertising support for the Q-Ack option. Such associations do not require the QAP to employ piggyback\n\nacknowledgments directed toward that associated STA in frames that are not directed to that associated STA. QSTAs shall be able to process received QoS data frames with subtypes that include +CF-Ack when the QSTA to which the acknowledgment is directed is the same as the QSTA addressed by the Address 1 field of that QoS data frame. A QSTA that does not set the Q-Ack subfield to 1 in the QoS Capability information element in the (ReAssociation Request frame is not required to handle the received QoS (+)Data+CF-Ack frames that are addressed to other QSTAs. The net effect of these restrictions on the use of QoS +CF-Ack frames is that the principal Qos +CF-Ack subtype that is useful is the QoS Data+CF-Ack frame, which can be sent by a non-AP QSTA as the first frame in a polled TXOP when that TXOP was conveyed in a QoS DatatCF-Poll(+CF-Ack) frame and the outgoing frame is directed to the HC's QSTA address. QoS (Data+)CF-Poll+CF-Ack frames are useful if the HC wants to grant another TXOP to the same non-AP QSTA a SIFS after receiving the final transmission of that non-AP QSTA's previous TXOP. QoS (Data+)CF-Poll+CF-Ack frames are also useful if the HC wants to grant another TXOP to a different nonAP QSTA a SIFS after receiving the final transmission of a non-AP QSTA's previous TXOP, if the non-AP QSTA that sent the final transmission of the previous TXOP has set the Q-Ack subfield in the QoS Capability information element in the (Re)Association Request frame to 1.\n\nHCF contention-based channel access shall not be used to transmit MSDUs belonging to an established TS (with the HC's acceptance of the associated TSPEC), unless the granted TSPEC indicates it is permitted to do so when the Access Policy subfield of the TS Info field is set to \"HCCA, EDCA mixed mode\" (HEMM), the polled QSTA utilized the full TXOP provided by the HC, and it has to send more MPDUs. When this QSTA sends frames belonging to a TS using contention-based channel access, it shall encode the TID subfield in the QoS data frame with the TID associated with the TS. When the QAP grants a TSPEC with the Access Policy subfield set to HEMM and if the corresponding AC needs admission control, the QAP shall include the medium time that specifies the granted time for EDCA access in the ADDTS Response frame.",

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"9.9.3.1.2 Procedure at non-AP QSTAs\"]\n\nThe MPDUExchangeTime equals the time required to transmit the MPDU sequence. For the case of an MPDU transmitted with Normal Ack policy and without RTS/CTS protection, this equals the time required to transmit the MPDU plus the time required to transmit the expected response frame plus one SIFS. If the used_time value reaches or exceeds the admitted_time value, the corresponding EDCAF shall no longer transmit using the EDCA parameters for that AC as specified in the QoS Parameter Set element. However, a non-AP QSTA may choose to temporarily replace the EDCA parameters for that EDCAF with those specified for an AC of lower priority, if no admission control is required for those ACs.\n\nIf, for example, a non-AP QSTA has made and had accepted an explicit admission for a TS and the channel conditions subsequently worsen, possibly including a change in PHY data rate so that it requires more time to send the same data, the non-AP QSTA may make a request for more admitted_time to the QAP and at the\n\nsame time downgrade the EDCA parameters for that AC for short intervals in order to send some of the traffic at the admitted priority and some at the unadmitted priority, while waiting for a response to the admission request.\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nThis subclause describes the schedule management of the admitted HCCA streams by the HC. When the HO provides controlled channel access to non-AP QSTAs, it is responsible for granting or denying polling service to a TS based on the parameters in the associated TSPEC. If the TS is admitted, the HC is responsible for scheduling channel access to this TS based on the negotiated TSPEC parameters. The HC should not initiate a modification of TSPEC parameters of an admitted TS unless requested by the STA. The HC should not tear down a TS unless explicitly requested by the STA or at the expiry of the inactivity timer. The polling service based on admitted TS provides a \"guaranteed channel access\" from the scheduler in order to have its QoS requirements met. This is an achievable goal when the WM operates free of external interference (such as operation within the channel by other technologies and co-channel overlapping BSS interference). The nature of wireless communications may preclude absolute guarantees to satisfy Qos requirements. However, in a controlled environment (e.g., no interference), the behavior of the scheduler can be observed and verified to be compliant to meet the service schedule.\n\nThe normative behavior of the scheduler is as follows:\n\nThe scheduler shall be implemented so that, under controlled operating conditions, all STAs with admitted TS are offered TXOPs that satisfy the service schedule.\n\nSpecifically, if a TS is admitted by the HC, then the scheduler shall service the non-AP QSTA during an SP. An SP is a contiguous time during which a set of one or more downlink unicast frames and/or one or more polled TXOPs are granted to the QSTA. An SP starts at fixed intervals of time specified in Service Interval field. The first SP starts when the lower order 4 bytes of the TSF timer equals the value specified in Service Start Time field.\" Additionally, the minimum TXOP duration shall be at least the time to transmit one maximum MSDU size successfully at the minimum PHY rate specified in the TSPEC. If maximum MSDU size is not specified in the TSPEC, then the minimum TXOP duration shall be at least the time to transmit one nominal MSDU size successfully at the minimum PHY rate. The vendors are free to implement any optimized algorithms, such as reducing the polling overheads, increasing the TXOP duration, etc., within the parameters of the transmitted schedule.\n\nWhen the HC aggregates the admitted TS, it shall set the Aggregation field in the granted TSPEC to 1. A QAP shall schedule the transmissions in HCCA TXOPs and communicate the service schedule to the nonAP QSTA. The HC shall provide an aggregate service schedule if the non-AP QSTA sets the Aggregation field in its TSPEC request. If the QAP establishes an aggregate service schedule for a non-AP QSTA, it shall aggregate all HCCA streams for the QSTA. The service schedule is communicated to the non-AP QSTA in a Schedule element contained in an ADDTS Response frame. In the ADDTS Response frame, the modified service start time shall not exceed the requested service start time, if specified in ADDTS Request frame, by more than one maximum service interval (SI). The HC uses the maximum SI for the initial scheduling only as there may be situations that HC may not be able to service the TS at the scheduled timing, due to an EDCA or DCF transmission or other interferences interrupting the schedule. The Service Interval field value in the Schedule element shall be greater than the minimum SI. The service schedule could be subsequently updated by a QAP as long as it meets TSPEC requirements.\n\nThe HC may update the service schedule at any time by sending a Schedule element in a Schedule frame. The updated schedule is in effect when the HC receives the ACK frame for the Schedule frame. The service start time in the Schedule element in the Schedule frame shall not exceed the beginning of the immediately\n\n17 The lower order 4 bytes of the TSF timer cover a span of around 71 min. Due to TSF timer wrapover and due to the possibility of receiving the schedule frame after the indicated start time timer, ambiguity may occur. This ambiguity is resolved by using the nearest absolute TSF timer value in past or future when the lower order 4 bytes match the Start Time field in the Schedule element.\n\nprevious SP by more than the maximum SI. The service start time shall not precede the beginning of the immediately previous SP by more than the minimum SI.\n\nA non-AP QSTA may affect the service schedule by modifying or deleting its existing TS as specified in\n\nK.3.1 provides guidelines for deriving an aggregate service schedule for a single non-AP QSTA from the non-AP QSTA's admitted TS. The schedule shall meet the QoS requirements specified in the TSPEC.\n\nDuring any time interval [t1, 12] including the interval that is greater than the specification interval, the cumulative TXOP duration shall be greater than the time required to transmit all MSDUs (of nominal MSDU size) arriving at the mean data rate for the stream, over the period [/1, 12 - DJ. The parameter D is set to the specified maximum SI in the TSPEC. If maximum SI is not specified, then D is set to the delay bound in the TSPEC.\n\nThe HC shall use the minimum PHY rate in calculating TXOPs if the minimum PHY rate is present in the TSPEC field in the ADDTS response. Otherwise, the HC may use an observed PHY rate in calculating TXOPs. Non-AP OSTAs may have an operational rate lower than the minimum PHY rate due to varying conditions on the channel for a short time and still may be able to sustain the TS without changing the minimum PHY rate in the TSPEC.\n\nA minimum set of TSPEC parameters shall be specified during the TSPEC negotiation. The specification of a minimum set of parameters is required so that the scheduler can determine a schedule for the stream that is to be admitted. These parameters are Mean Data Rate, Nominal MSDU Size, Minimum PHY Rate, Surplus Bandwidth Allowance, and at least one of Maximum Service Interval and Delay Bound in the ADDTS Request frame. In the ADDTS Response frame, these parameters are Mean Data Rate, Nominal MSDU Size, Minimum PHY Rate, Surplus Bandwidth Allowance, and Maximum Service Interval and shall be nonzero when a stream is admitted.\n\nalternative set of TSPEC parameters, these parameters are indicated to the non-AP QSTA through the ADDTS Response frame. If both maximum SI and delay bound are specified, the HC may use only the maximum SI. If any other parameter is specified in the TSPEC element, the scheduler may use it when calculating the schedule for the stream. The HC may also use the UP value in the TS Info field for admission control or scheduling purposes; however, this decision is outside the scope of this amendment. The mandatory set of parameters can be set by any higher layer entity or may be generated autonomously by the MAC.\n\nIf a QSTA specifies a nonzero minimum SI and if the TS is admitted, the HC shall generate a schedule that conforms to the specified minimum SI.\n\nA reference design for a sample scheduler and admission control unit is provided in Annex K. A sample use of the TSPEC for admission control is also described in Annex K\n\nInsert after 9.9.3.2 the following new subclauses (9.10 through 9.10.5), including the new figures in those subclauses:",

      "A QSTA that intends to use the Block Ack mechanism for the transmission of QoS data frames to a peer should first check whether the intended peer QSTA is capable of participating in Block Ack mechanism by discovering and examining its Delayed Block Ack and Immediate Block Ack capability bits. If the intended peer QSTA is capable of participating, the originator sends an ADDBA Request frame indicating the TID for which the Block Ack is being set up. The Block Ack Policy and Buffer Size fields in the ADDBA Request frame are advisory and may be changed by the recipient. The receiving QSTA shall respond by an ADDBA Response frame. The receiving OSTA, which is the intended peer, has the option of accepting or rejecting the request. When the QSTA accepts, then a Block Ack agreement exists between the originator and recipient. When the QSTA accepts, it indicates the type of Block Ack and the number of buffers that it shall allocate for the support of this block. If the receiving OSTA rejects the request, then the originator shall not use the Block Ack mechanism.",

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"9.10.1 Introduction\"]\n\nThe Block Ack mechanism is initialized by an exchange of ADDBA Request/Response frames. After initialization, blocks of QoS data frames can be transmitted from the originator to the recipient. A block may be started within a polled TXOP or by winning EDCA contention. The number of frames in the block is limited, and the amount of state that is to be kept by the recipient is bounded. The MPDUs within the block of frames are acknowledged by a BlockAck control frame, which is requested by a BlockAckReq control frame.\n\nThe Block Ack mechanism does not require the setting up of a TS; however, QSTAs using the TS facility may choose to signal their intention to use Block Ack mechanism for the scheduler's consideration in assigning TXOPs. Acknowledgments of frames belonging to the same TID, but transmitted during multiple TXOPs, may also be combined into a single BlockAck frame. This mechanism allows the originator to have flexibility regarding the transmission of data MPDUs. The originator may split the block of frames across TXOPs, separate the data transfer and the Block Ack exchange, and interleave blocks of MSDUs for different TIDs or RAs.\n\nFigure 62e illustrates the message sequence chart for the setup, data and Block Ack transfer, and the teardown of the Block Ack mechanism, which are discussed in detail in 9.10.2 through 9.10.5.\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nA QSTA that intends to use the Block Ack mechanism for the transmission of QoS data frames to a peer should first check whether the intended peer QSTA is capable of participating in Block Ack mechanism by discovering and examining its Delayed Block Ack and Immediate Block Ack capability bits.

The first scheduled SP starts when the lower order 4 bytes of the TSF timer equals the value specified in the Service Start Time ield. A non-AP QSTA using scheduled SP shall first wake up to receive downlink unicast frames buffered and/or polls from the AP/HC. The STA shall wake up subsequently at a fixed time interval equal to the SI The QAP may modify the service start time by indicating so in the Schedule element in ADDTS Response frame and in Schedule frames.\n\nA scheduled SP begins at the scheduled wakeup time that corresponds to the SI and the service start time indicated in the Schedule element sent in response to a TSPEC. The STA shall wake up at a subsequent time when\n\n(TSF - service start time) mod minimum SI = 0.\n\nIf scheduled services periods are supported in a QBSS, a QSTA may use both unscheduled and scheduled APSD on different ACs at the same time. When a non-AP QSTA establishes scheduled delivery for an AC, that AC shall be considered delivery-enabled. However, the QAP shall not transmit frames associated with that AC during an SP that is initiated by a trigger frame, and it shall not treat frames associated with the AC\n\nthat are received from the STA as trigger frames. The QAP shall decline any ADDTS Request frame that indicates the use of both scheduled and unscheduled APSD to be used on the same AC at the same time.\n\nAPSD shall be used only to deliver unicast frames to a QSTA. Broadcast/multicast frame delivery shall follow the frame delivery rules defined for broadcast/multicast frames as defined in 11.2.1.5.\n\nChange the following subclause number due to the insertion above of the new subclause, 11.2.1.4, and change the text as shown:",

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"11.2.2 Power management in an IBSS\"]\n\nThis subclause specifies the power management mechanism for use within an IBSS.\n\nIn a QIBSS, a OSTA shall not operate in PS mode while it has Block Ack set up with another OSTA. A OSTA may be in PS mode before the setup of Block Ack. Once Block Ack is set up with another OSTA, the OSTA suspends the PS mode and shall always remain awake.\n\nInsert after 11.3.4 the following new subclauses as 11.4 through 11.7.5, including the new figures and tables in those subclauses (instructions for renumbering the existing 11.4 through 11.6 are given after this new text):\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nA TSPEC describes the traffic characteristics and the QoS requirements of a TS. The main purpose of the TSPEC is to reserve resources within the HC and modify the HC's scheduling behavior. It also allows other parameters to be specified that are associated with the TS, such as a traffic classifier and acknowledgment policy.\n\nA TS may have one or more TCLAS (within the discretion of the QSTA that sets up the stream) associated with it. The QAP uses the parameters in the TCLAS elements to filter the MSDUs belonging to this TS so that they can be delivered with the QoS parameters that have been set up for the TS.\n\nTSPEC and the optional TCLAS elements are transported on the air by the ADDTS, in the corresponding QoS Action frame and across the MLME SAP by the MLME-ADDTS primitives.\n\nFollowing a successful negotiation, a TS is created, identified within the non-AP QSTA by its TSID and direction, and identified within the HC by a combination of TSID, direction, and non-AP QSTA address.\n\nIt is always the responsibility of the non-AP QSTA to initiate the creation of a TS regardless of its direction.\n\nIn the direct-link case, it is the responsibility of the non-AP QSTA that is going to send the data to create the TS. In this case, the non-AP QSTA negotiates with the HC to gain TXOPs that it uses to send the data. There is no negotiation between the originator and recipient non-AP QSTAs concerning the TS: the originator can discover the capabilities of the recipient (rates, BlockAck) using the DLS.\n\nIn the case of traffic relayed by a QAP, the sending and receiving non-AP QSTAs may both create individual TS for the traffic. Any traffic classifier created for the downlink TS applies equally regardless of whether the source is in the same BSS or reached through the DS.\n\nA non-AP QSTA may simultaneously support up to eight TSs from the HC to itself and up to eight TSs from itself to other QSTAs, including the HC. The actual number it supports may be less due to implementation restrictions.\n\nA HC may simultaneously support up to eight downlink TSs and up to eight uplink TSs per associated nonAP QSTA. The actual number it supports may be less due to implementation restrictions.\n\nThe traffic admitted in context of a TSPEC can be sent using EDCA or HCCA or HEMM.

In addition, TXOP limits would typically be chosen to be as short as possible (within the constraints of the minimum PHY rate, acknowledgment policy, and so forth), consistent with the goal of maximizing throughput. In other words, because of overhead, not to mention the requirements for transmitting a single Poll frame, MPDU, and possibly ACK frame, the TXOPs need to be at least of a certain duration.",
      "The channel model implies an error rate and an assumption about dependency (joint probability distribution of channel errors sequentially, i.e., burst error probabilities).",
      "For example, if the channel causes errors independently from frame to frame and the error probability is the same for all frames of the same length at all times, this channel would be said to be an independent, identically distributed error channel. With pas the probability of dropping the frame, and pe as the probability of the frame not being transmitted successfully (i.e., either the data frame or the ACK frame associated with it is in error), let N, be the number of retries required to maintain the probability of dropping the frame to be p.",
      "The probability of any given packet being dropped in such a channel after N, retries is given by",
      "For example, in such a channel, if Pe = 0.1 and Pdrop = 10-8 , then up to seven retries within the delay bound are required, and the scheduler should ensure that sufficient cumulative TXOP allocations are made to accommodate retransmissions.",
      "The Surplus Bandwidth Allowance parameter ensures the requesting QSTA is allocated a minimum amount of excess time by the scheduler to so that application dropped packet rates are bounded. For example, this parameter can be chosen to ensure that when there is a 10% packet error rate (PER) for 1000-octet packets, that there is a dropped PER (i.e., packets that fail to be received within the delay bound) of 10-8. . This parameter may be chosen based on an initial assumption regarding channel/source characteristics and renegotiated by sending ADDTS Request frames if required, based on actual transmission behavior. To understand how this parameter may be specified, consider the case where there are only 100 PPDUs to be transmitted and delay is not an issue. The PER Pe is 10%, with the errors happening independently from packet to packet. To accomplish this, the number of packets transmitted in each beacon interval must exceed the 100 PPDUs by Nexcess in order to avoid dropping packets with some fixed probability (denoted as Pdrop). or example, if Pdrop = 10-8 , then the number of retries Nexcess must satisfy to send only 100 packets sucessfullv (based on Bernoulli distributed error probabilities):",

      "where Ip (a, b) is the Incomplete Beta function, and taking n sufficiently large (or invoking the law of large numbers). Solving this yields that, on the average, 38 additional MPDUs are required to keep the probability of dropping a packet to less than 10-8 to send only 100 packets. For this case, the",
      "Surplus bandwidth allowance = 100 + Nexess, which for this example would be 1.38.",
      "This might represent an upper bound for the excess bandwidth for many applications: it presumes that the observation interval is 100 + Nexcess frames. When the observation interval (or delay bound) is longer than the time it takes to transmit 100 frames, then it can be shown that the excess bandwidth required decreases. For example, if it were desired to send 100 000 frames with 12 000 frames excess, then the probability of a dropped frame becomes 1.6 × 10-15",
      "On the other hand, suppose that an infinitely long stream was to be transmitted without any constraints on delay. In such a case, with an infinite number of retries and with a 10% PER, 1.111 times the bandwidth required to send MPDUs without error is required (because the probability that n retries are required for any packet is given by 0.1\").",
      "In fact, assuming a finite delay bound, the above result (1.111= surplus bandwidth allowance) represents a lower bound on what the surplus bandwidth allowance would be.",
      "Typically, then the excess bandwidth required would be between a \"send only N + excess packets\" scenario within a given delay and \"send an infinite number of packets with an infinite number of retries with no delay\" scenario.",
      "A more exact calculation can be done via simulation as follows: Suppose there are Nallocated constant length PPDUs per beacon interval (these are actually transmitted on the air), and suppose there are payload constant length PPDUs to be transmitted. Suppose further that these transmitted and payload PPDUs arrive in a uniformly distributed manner in each beacon interval, then the delay incurred in waiting for a packet to be transmitted may be inferred from examining the transmit queue length and statistically may be inferred from examining how many retries within a certain period of time are required to keep the probability of a dropped packet below a certain amount. The number of retries (and consideration of IFS, polls, etc.) then determines the surplus bandwidth allowance.",
      "In general, then the surplus bandwidth allowance may be given by allocated payload",
      "Note that for the case of a Block Ack, a similar calculation applies, although the calculations for the excess bandwidth need to take into account the probability of failing to receive a Block Ack, and so forth."

For example, this parameter can be chosen to ensure that when there is a 10% packet error rate (PER) for 1000-octet packets, that there is a dropped PER (i.e., packets that fail to be received within the delay bound) of 10-8. . This parameter may be chosen based on an initial assumption regarding channel/source characteristics and renegotiated by sending ADDTS Request frames if required, based on actual transmission behavior. To understand how this parameter may be specified, consider the case where there are only 100 PPDUs to be transmitted and delay is not an issue. The PER Pe is 10%, with the errors happening independently from packet to packet. To accomplish this, the number of packets transmitted in each beacon interval must exceed the 100 PPDUs by Nexcess in order to avoid dropping packets with some fixed probability (denoted as Pdrop). or example, if Pdrop = 10-8 , then the number of retries Nexcess must satisfy to send only 100 packets sucessfullv (based on Bernoulli distributed error probabilities):\n\nwhere pe = 0.1.

For this case, the\n\nSurplus bandwidth allowance = 100 + Nexess, which for this example would be 1.38.\n\nThis might represent an upper bound for the excess bandwidth for many applications: it presumes that the observation interval is 100 + Nexcess frames. When the observation interval (or delay bound) is longer than the time it takes to transmit 100 frames, then it can be shown that the excess bandwidth required decreases. For example, if it were desired to send 100 000 frames with 12 000 frames excess, then the probability of a dropped frame becomes 1.6 × 10-15\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that an infinitely long stream was to be transmitted without any constraints on delay.

    "full_text": "[...overlap from previous section: \"K.3.1 Guidelines for deriving service schedule parameters\"]\n\nThe HC establishes the SI for each admitted TS for a non-AP QSTA to derive the aggregate minimum SI contained in the non-AP QSTA's service schedule. The SI for each TS is equal to a nonzero minimum SI contained in the TSPEC, if it exists; otherwise, it is the nominal MSDU size divided by the mean data rate. The SI contained in the service schedule is equal to the smallest SI for any TSPEC.\n\nThe HC may use an aggregate \"token bucket specification\" to police a non-AP QSTA's admitted flows. The bucket specification. The aggregate mean data rate is equal to the sum of the mean data rates of all of the non-AP QSTA's admitted TSs. The aggregate burst size is equal to the sum of the burst size of all of the non-AP QSTA's admitted TSs. An aggregate token bucket is initialized with the aggregate burst size. Tokens are added to the token bucket at the aggregate mean data rate.\n\n[...end overlap]\n\n\n\nTSPECs are constructed at the SME from application requirements supplied via the SME and with information specific to the MAC layer. There are no normative requirements on how any TSPEC is to be generated However, in this subclause a description is given of how and where certain parameters may be chosen. The ollowing parameters typically arise from the application: Nominal MSDU Size, Maximum MSDU Size Minimum Service Interval, Maximum Service Interval, Inactivity Interval, Minimum Data Rate, Mean Data Rate, Burst Size, Peak Data Rate, and Delay Bound. The following parameters are generated locally within the MAC: Minimum PHY Rate and Surplus Bandwidth Allowance, although the Maximum Service Interval and Minimum Service Intervals may be generated within the MLME as well. This subclause describes how the parameters that are typically generated within the MAC may be derived.\n\nNote that a TSPEC may also be generated autonomously by the MAC without any initiation by the SME. However, if a TSPEC is generated subsequently by the SME, the TSPEC generated autonomously by the MAC shall be overridden. If one or more TSPECs are initiated by the SME, the autonomous TSPEC, containing the same TSID, shall be terminated.\n\nTypically, TSPEC parameters not determined by the application are built upon the assumption that the following exist:\n\n— A probability p of not transmitting the frame (because it would have exceeded its delay bound)\n\nAn MSDU length (which can be considered fixed for constant-bit-rate applications)\n\nApplication throughput and delay requirements\n\n— A channel model of error, in particular a channel error probability for the (fixed) frame length\n\n— Possibly country-specific limits on TXOP limits\n\nThe minimum service interval, if determined within the MAC, may typically be given as the nominal MSDU size/mean data rate.\n\nThe maximum service interval, if determined within the MAC, may be calculated as the delay bound/numer of retries possible. This number should be greater than the minimum SI, when that is specified. Th umber of retries may be chosen (as below) to meet a particular probability of dropping a packet because i exceeds its delay bound. Note that for multiple streams, this SI should be the aggregate of all SIs requested. because the QSTA is assigned the TXOPs, not any particular stream.\n\nTypically, it can be assumed that the scheduler would attempt to schedule TXOPs distributed throughout a small multiple of beacon intervals (if not a single beacon interval). In addition, TXOP limits would typically be chosen to be as short as possible (within the constraints of the minimum PHY rate, acknowledgment policy, and so forth), consistent with the goal of maximizing throughput.
